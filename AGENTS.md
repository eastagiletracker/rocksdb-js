## Development Commands

### Building

- `pnpm build` - Full production build (TypeScript bundle + native C++ binding)
- `pnpm build:binding` - Incremental build C++ binding only (production)
- `pnpm build:binding:debug` - Incremental build C++ binding only (debug)
- `pnpm build:bundle` - TypeScript only (unminified)
- `pnpm build:bundle:minify` - TypeScript only (minified)
- `pnpm rebuild` - Configure and build C++ binding only (production)
- `pnpm rebuild:debug` - Native C++ binding only (with debug logging and coverage)

### Testing

- `pnpm test` - Run all tests with Vitest using Node.js
- `pnpm coverage` - Run all tests with Vitest and coverage report
- `pnpm coverage:native` - Native tests with gcov/lcov report in `coverage/native/html/` (Unix only)
- `node --expose-gc ./node_modules/vitest/vitest.mjs test/specific.test.ts` - Run single test file

- `pnpm test:deno` - Run all tests with Vitest using Deno
- `pnpm test:stress` - Run all stress tests with Vitest using Node.js
- `pnpm test:native` - Build and run C++ GoogleTest unit tests (no Node runtime in test binary)
- `pnpm bench` - Run all benchmarks with Vitest using Node.js

### Code Quality

- `pnpm check` - Run type-check, lint, and format checking
- `pnpm fmt` - Format code with oxfmt
- `pnpm fmt:check` - Check code formatting with oxfmt
- `pnpm lint` - Code linting with oxlint
- `pnpm type-check` - TypeScript type checking only

**Run `pnpm fmt` before every commit** (or `pnpm check` to also type-check and lint) — CI runs
`pnpm fmt:check` and fails the build on unformatted code. Note the scope: oxfmt formats TS/JS/JSON
**and Markdown**, but **not C++**, so a stray indent under `src/binding/**` passes `fmt:check`
untouched and must be checked by hand. Markdown is checked, which includes the ordered list of
invariants below: a branch that adds an invariant while `main` adds another **renumbers cleanly in
git and still fails `fmt:check` on the merge ref**, because both sides claim the same number. Rebase
onto `main` and renumber before pushing rather than reading the red check as unrelated.

### Development Workflow

- `pnpm clean` - Clean native build artifacts
- `pnpm build:bundle && pnpm rebuild:debug` - Full debug build for development

## Architecture Overview

This is a Node.js binding for RocksDB that provides both TypeScript and C++ layers:

### TypeScript Layer (`src/`)

- **`database.ts`** - Main `RocksDatabase` class extending `DBI` with transaction support
- **`backup.ts`** - `backups` namespace (restore/list/delete/purge/verify) over RocksDB's `BackupEngine`; backup creation is `RocksDatabase.backup()`
- **`store.ts`** - Core `Store` class wrapping native database with encoding/decoding
- **`transaction.ts`** - Transaction implementation for atomic operations
- **`dbi.ts` & `dbi-iterator.ts`** - Database interface and iteration logic
- **`encoding.ts`** - Key/value encoding with msgpack and ordered-binary support
- **`load-binding.ts`** - Native module loading and configuration
- **`parse-transaction-log.ts`** - Utility for reading raw transaction log files
- **`transaction-log.ts`** - Transaction log implementation for storing transaction related data
- **`transaction.ts`** - Transaction-specific context for transactional operations
- **`util.ts`** - Various helpers
- **`validate-transaction-log.ts`** - `validateTransactionLogStore()` over the native validator
  (`src/binding/transaction_log/transaction_log_validation.cpp`); also used by `backups.verify()`
  (strict mode) and the CLI `verify-logs` command

### C++ Native Layer (`src/binding/`)

Layout (include via `src/binding` root, e.g. `#include "core/encoding.h"`):

- **`core/`** - No `node_api.h`: encoding, `DBException`, platform helpers, debug logging
- **`napi/`** - N-API helpers, macros, async work (`BaseAsyncState`), module `binding.h`
- **`database/`**, **`transaction/`**, **`iterator/`**, **`transaction_log/`**, **`stats/`** -
  domain code and JS bridge classes
- **`binding.cpp`** - `NAPI_MODULE_INIT` entry point
- **`options/db_options.h`** - Parsed open options (plain C++)

`core/` and `transaction_log/` store/file code are suitable for **GoogleTest** without Node.
N-API surface remains covered by Vitest (`test/*.test.ts`). Native tests live in `test/native/`.

### Key Design Patterns

1. **Hybrid Sync/Async**: Operations return promises for disk I/O or immediate values for cached
   data
2. **Encoding Strategy**: Keys use ordered-binary encoding, values default to msgpack
3. **Store Pattern**: `Store` class encapsulates database instance and encoding logic, shared
   between `RocksDatabase` and `Transaction`
4. **Native Binding**: Uses node-gyp with C++20, links against prebuilt RocksDB libraries
5. **Backups**: Whole-database (all column families) via RocksDB's `BackupEngine`
   (`src/binding/database/backup.cpp`). Creating a backup is the `Database::Backup` instance
   method (needs the open DB); restore/list/delete/purge/verify are module-level functions
   operating on a backup directory with no open DB.
6. **Compression**: a **per-column-family** open option (`compression`), normalized in the TS Store
   layer (`normalizeCompression` — string | `{algorithm, level}` → native string + validated int32
   level) and applied to the target CF's options. Non-obvious points:
   - The algorithm is applied to **both** `ColumnFamilyOptions::compression` (SST blocks) **and**
     `blob_compression_type` — this codebase enables blob files for values ≥ 2KB, and blob
     compression defaults to none, so setting only block compression leaves large values
     uncompressed. `compression_opts.level` carries an optional level.
   - **Per-CF preservation is load-bearing and easy to get wrong.** RocksDB requires opening _every_
     CF at once with the options you pass, and does **not** restore persisted per-CF options on its
     own. So `DBDescriptor::open` calls `LoadLatestOptions` (`rocksdb/utilities/options_util.h`) to
     read each existing CF's persisted compression, opens each CF with _its own_ value, and applies
     the caller's request **only** to the target CF (`options.name`) — and only when it was
     _explicitly_ requested. A cold open of one CF must never restamp the others (that was the bug
     Kris caught: first-open order used to dictate every CF's algorithm). New CFs
     (`createRocksDBColumnFamily`) get the request/default. Because the OPTIONS file is the _only_
     authoritative source, a non-OK `LoadLatestOptions` for an **existing** DB (missing/corrupt
     OPTIONS) **fails the open** rather than falling back to defaults — falling back would reopen the
     non-target CFs with the base default and silently restamp them. Applying an explicit algorithm
     **without** a level resets `compression_opts.level` to `kDefaultCompressionLevel` (it must not
     inherit the target CF's persisted level, e.g. cold-reopening a zstd-level-19 CF as zlib).
   - The default is **LZ4** (overriding RocksDB's Snappy default), applied natively in
     `Database::Open` when unset; build-dependent, so it falls back to RocksDB's default when LZ4
     isn't linked. The default is marked **non-explicit** (`DBOptions::compressionExplicit`) so it
     never overrides an existing CF and a plain reopen inherits the live value.
   - A second in-process open of an already-open CF (the `DBDescriptor` is process-global, shared
     across handles/`worker_threads`) with an **explicitly different** algorithm, blob algorithm, _or_
     level is **rejected** (throws in `DBRegistry::OpenDB`, comparing all three against the live
     `GetOptions`). The level compared is the _effective_ request — omitting a level means
     `kDefaultCompressionLevel`, not "inherit" — and the blob check catches a legacy CF opened plainly
     with `block=snappy`/`blob=none` that a later explicit `snappy` open would otherwise leave with
     uncompressed blobs.
   - `supportedCompression` (module constant from `rocksdb::GetSupportedCompressions()`) is the
     source of truth; name↔enum mapping lives in the Node-free `core/compression.{h,cpp}`
     (GoogleTest-covered). The `db.compression` getter returns `{ algorithm, level? }` read live via
     `DB::GetOptions` (level omitted when it is the default sentinel).
   - `scripts/configure-rocksdb.mjs` (run by `binding.gyp` at configure) provisions the pinned
     prebuild then emits the compression libs to link as **whitespace-free** `-l` flags / `.lib`
     names (never absolute paths), resolved via a single `library_dirs` entry — so a repo checked
     out under a path with spaces still links (gyp `<!@()` splits output on whitespace).

### Transaction Architecture

- Optimistic (default): Conflicts detected at commit time
- Pessimistic: Conflicts throw immediately on detection
- Both modes support async/sync APIs with automatic commit/rollback

### Iterator Design

Uses `ExtendedIterable` wrapper around native iterators for array-like methods (map, filter, etc.)
with lazy evaluation.

### Event Emitters

The codebase has **two** event surfaces backed by the same `EventEmitter` class in
`napi/event_emitter.h`:

- **Per-database**: instance methods on `RocksDatabase` (`db.addListener`, `db.notify`,
  `db.listeners`, `db.removeListener`). Listeners are scoped to a `DBDescriptor` and cleaned
  up when the owning `DBHandle` closes. Native exports live on the `Database` class prototype.
- **Process-global**: static methods on `RocksDatabase` (`RocksDatabase.on`, `.addListener`,
  `.off`, `.removeListener`, `.listenerCount`, `.notify`). Used for events that have no
  natural database context — e.g. warnings from the transaction log layer. Native exports
  live on the binding module root (`binding.addListener`, etc.), wired via `GlobalEvents::Init`.
  The underlying `EventEmitter` is a C++ magic-static singleton — it is **shared across
  every Node env that loads this .node binary in the same process**, so listeners
  registered on the main thread will receive events emitted from `worker_threads`
  workers and vice versa. When an env is torn down (e.g. a worker exits), its
  cleanup hook calls `EventEmitter::removeListenersByEnv(env)` so that env's
  tsfns / napi_refs are released and the singleton is left with no dangling pointers.

When wiring a new listener-related export from TypeScript, pick the right one: the binding
module's `addListener` is **global**; the per-DB `addListener` is on the `Database` class.
`load-binding.ts` renames the global exports to `addGlobalListener` / `removeGlobalListener`
/ `globalListenerCount` / `globalNotify` to make the distinction explicit in TS.

C++ code that needs to emit to JS without a database context should call
`emitGlobalEvent(key, data)` from `napi/global_events.h`. Use namespaced keys
(`'transactionLog:warning'`) for internal events to avoid collisions with user-defined ones.

### Commit execution

Async `Transaction.commit()` does not use the libuv threadpool: each database
has a dedicated commit thread (`CommitWorker`, owned by the shared
`DBDescriptor`) that runs the txn-log write + RocksDB commit in dispatch order,
so slow commits cannot starve fs/dns/crypto/async-get work sharing the libuv
pool. `ROCKSDB_JS_COMMIT_THREAD` selects the mode (`0`/`false` = legacy libuv
path, default = single lane, `2` = experimental two-lane txnlog→commit
pipeline). Completions are marshalled back to the originating env via per-env
tsfns in per-env `CommitCompletion` objects. `commitMutex` protects only the
registry lookup/creation and removal. Each DBHandle caches its env's completion
on the owning JS thread and resets that cache on reopen; cross-env close leaves
it alone. An in-flight commit retains its completion
object and calls/finishes under that object's mutex, so independent envs do not
serialize on the descriptor for dispatch and accounting. A dying env's tsfn is
released under the same completion mutex from the module env-cleanup hook
(`DBRegistry::ReleaseCommitCompletionsByEnv`) — the same env-teardown discipline
as `EventEmitter::notify` above. Registry removal holds `commitMutex` through
completion release (registry → completion is the only nested lock order): removing
an entry before releasing its TSFN lets concurrent env cleanup miss that entry and
return before the TSFN is safe. A retained completion object does not pin the Node
env; its terminal closed flag prevents a delayed registration or dispatch from
reviving the released TSFN. A per-commit tsfn acquire is NOT
sufficient (env teardown does not honor tsfn acquire counts); see
`test/commit-teardown.test.ts` and the `ROCKSDB_JS_COMMIT_DELAY_MS` test seam.
Every path registers its native execute in the descriptor's
`operationsInFlight` count before queueing and rechecks `isClosing()` afterward
(publish-then-check, so teardown either waits for the operation or the commit
observes the close and rejects). In the lane modes this must precede the
`DBHandle` completion-cache access: foreign shutdown can reset the transaction's
`dbHandle` before admission. The local descriptor pin is declared before the pending
commit state so setup-error cleanup releases its operation count while the descriptor
is still alive. The operation releases only after the transaction's
async-work registration is cleared — legacy from its libuv execute thread, the
lane modes at the end of the commit stage. This makes direct shutdown wait for
the native commit rather than destroy RocksDB after the transaction handle's
bounded drain expires. The recheck is not redundant with
`commitCompletionsClosed`, which `finishClose()` sets only after it has passed
the drain gate and stopped both lanes; a commit that registered its completion
just before that would otherwise reach `CommitWorker::enqueue` on a stopped
lane, which runs the task inline. The legacy commit state also pins
the descriptor through its JS completion and retries `PurgeIfUnreferenced()` when
that pin was why a last-handle `close()` deferred teardown. Direct shutdown can
therefore wait without a bound for a stalled commit; releasing the counter from
the thread that ran the commit, rather than from its JS completion, keeps that
wait deadlock-free. The unified admission/drain contract tracked by #784 remains the
larger cleanup; legacy mode stays as the documented operational escape hatch.

## Environment Variables

- `ROCKSDB_VERSION` - Override RocksDB version (default from package.json, or 'latest')
- `ROCKSDB_PATH` - Build from local RocksDB source instead of prebuilt
- `MINIFY=1` - Enable minification of TypeScript bundle
- `KEEP_FILES=1` - Don't delete temporary test databases for debugging purposes
- `ROCKSDB_JS_COMMIT_THREAD` - Async-commit execution mode: `0`/`false` = legacy
  libuv threadpool, unset = dedicated per-database commit thread (default),
  `2` = experimental two-lane pipeline
- `ROCKSDB_JS_COMMIT_DELAY_MS` - Test-only: delay on the commit thread before
  each completion callback (widens teardown race windows)
- `ROCKSDB_JS_COMMIT_EXECUTE_DELAY_MS` / `ROCKSDB_JS_TXN_GET_DELAY_MS` - Test-only delays
  immediately before a native transaction commit (while its async work and descriptor operation
  remain registered, widening close-vs-execute race windows) and before a transaction's
  cold-cache async get reads (exercising orphan cleanup past the async-work wait timeout). Both
  are snapshotted in `initializeTestSeams()` before native worker execution, so they must be set
  in the environment that starts the process (not through an in-process `process.env` write).
- `ROCKSDB_JS_PARK_TIMEOUT_MS` - Bounded wait (default `5000`) before a
  coordinated-retry commit parked on a conflicting holder's VT lock resolves
  RETRY_NOW unconditionally, in case the holder never releases (see
  "Coordinated retry" note below). Read once per process (a function-local
  `static`, like the other two above — `::getenv` is not safe against a
  concurrent `::setenv` from a `process.env` write, and a park runs on whichever
  env's JS thread owns the transaction), so it must be set in the environment a
  process is started with. Values below `50` are clamped up to it, and `0` (an
  ambiguous "disable the bound") falls back to the default like any malformed
  value. There is no opt-out: a deployment that would rather wait than fail a
  legitimately slow holder raises the value instead
- `ROCKSDB_JS_WBM_STALL_WARN_MS` - How long a `WriteBufferManager` stall must be
  _continuously_ active (default `5000`) before the stall watchdog writes its one
  warn line. `0` disables the watchdog entirely (and with it
  `writeBufferManager.stallActiveMs`); a value below the 1s sample interval clamps
  up to it; malformed, negative or above 24h falls back to the default. Read once
  per process via a function-local `static` (the watchdog runs off the JS thread —
  same `::getenv`-vs-`process.env` caveat as `ROCKSDB_JS_PARK_TIMEOUT_MS`), so it
  must be set in the environment a process is started with
- `ROCKSDB_JS_WRITE_STALL_DEBOUNCE_MS` - Rate-limit window (default `1000`) for the
  per-database `'writeStall'` event. The event is rising-edge only (fires when a
  column family enters a stall); during a sustained oscillating stall it re-emits
  at most once per window. Recovery is not pushed (see `isWriteStalled()`). Resolved
  once at `DBDescriptor` construction on the JS thread (the emit path runs on a
  RocksDB background thread; this avoids `::getenv` there — same
  `::getenv`-vs-`process.env` caveat as `ROCKSDB_JS_PARK_TIMEOUT_MS`), so it must be
  set in the environment a process is started with. `0` disables the window (every
  rising edge emits); malformed/negative falls back to the default
- `ROCKSDB_JS_DESTROY_DELAY_MS` - Test-only: delay after descriptor teardown and
  before physical database destruction (widens same-path reopen races). Snapshotted in
  `initializeTestSeams()` — it is read on whichever thread drives teardown, so it must be set in
  the environment that starts the process
- `ROCKSDB_JS_OPEN_ATTACH_DELAY_MS` - Test-only: delay after `DBRegistry::OpenDB()` has atomically
  adopted and attached a handle, but before the native open returns to JavaScript (proves a forced
  destroy cannot claim the descriptor during the former return/adopt/attach gap). Snapshotted in
  `initializeTestSeams()` so every open avoids a `getenv()` call
- `ROCKSDB_JS_ITERATOR_NEXT_DELAY_MS` / `ROCKSDB_JS_COUNT_DELAY_MS` - Test-only: per-row delays in
  `DBIterator::Next()` and `DBIteratorHandle::countRemaining()`. Both are read **once** in
  `initializeTestSeams()` rather than per row: these are the two per-row native loops, and a
  `getenv()` scan per row is a measurable share of their cost for a seam unset in production. Add
  new per-row seams the same way.
- `ROCKSDB_JS_COMPACT_DELAY_MS` - Test-only: upper bound (ms) that a **cancellable** manual
  `compactRange()` parks before handing the range to RocksDB, returning as soon as the cancel
  token that caller was given is armed. Lets a fixture hold a compaction across a close claim
  without depending on how long a real compaction runs; snapshotted in `initializeTestSeams()`
  like the per-row seams above, so the production path costs one relaxed load per manual
  compaction. Used by `test/fixtures/fork-compact-cancel-{sync,async,close,destroy}.mts`
- `ROCKSDB_JS_CLOSE_FLUSH_FAILURE` - Test-only: number of close-time flushes to fail with an
  injected `IOError` (a **count**, not a flag; `1` is one failure). More than one is what leaves a
  descriptor still quarantined at process exit, since the exit-time `DBRegistry::Shutdown()`
  consumes a failure of its own on the retry — see invariant 26
- `ROCKSDB_JS_CLOSE_FAILURE` / `ROCKSDB_JS_DESTROY_FAILURE` - Test-only: inject a one-shot native
  close failure, or fail every physical `DestroyDB` for the life of the process. Both are fault
  **flags**, so both are snapshotted in `initializeTestSeams()` rather than re-read: `::getenv`
  races a `process.env` write from another thread, and these are read from teardown paths that can
  run on any thread
- `ROCKSDB_JS_CLOSE_RETRY_DELAY_MS` - Test-only: delay inside a _resumed_ `finishClose()` (the
  `shutdown()`/`destroy()` retry of a quarantined descriptor), widening the window in which a
  concurrent open must wait for the retry rather than reopen the path. Snapshotted in
  `initializeTestSeams()` for the same reason as `ROCKSDB_JS_DESTROY_DELAY_MS`
- `ROCKSDB_JS_BACKUP_DELAY_MS` - Test-only: delay inside a native backup copy, holding it across a
  concurrent destroy claim. Snapshotted in `initializeTestSeams()` — the copy runs on a libuv
  worker, so it must be set in the environment that starts the process
- `ROCKSDB_JS_REGISTRY_STATUS_COLUMNS_DELAY_MS` - Test-only: per-column-family delay inside
  `registryStatus()`'s column walk, so a concurrent `dropSync()` or close-time `columns.clear()`
  lands in the middle of it (`test/fixtures/fork-registry-status-column-race.mts`). Snapshotted in
  `initializeTestSeams()` like the seams above
- `ROCKSDB_JS_ITERATOR_SETUP_DELAY_MS` / `ROCKSDB_JS_TXN_CLOSE_DELAY_MS` - Test-only delays inside
  iterator construction and transaction close. Both are snapshotted in `initializeTestSeams()`, so
  they must be set in the environment that starts the process rather than through an in-process
  `process.env` write.
- `ROCKSDB_JS_CF_RECLAIM_WAIT_MS` - How long `open()` of a column-family name whose
  previous generation is still awaiting its physical drop waits before throwing
  (default `30000`). The open polls in 20 ms slices; the bound covers the full
  interval from commit admission through transaction-log work, commit-lane queuing,
  the RocksDB write, and reclamation. Read once per process via a function-local `static` — same
  `::getenv`-vs-`process.env` caveat as `ROCKSDB_JS_PARK_TIMEOUT_MS` — so it must be
  set in the environment a process is started with. Malformed, non-positive, or above
  24h falls back to the default; there is no opt-out (see invariant 24)

## Test Structure

- **Vitest** (`test/*.test.ts`): TypeScript integration tests; `pnpm test` / `pnpm coverage`
- **GoogleTest** (`test/native/*.cc`): C++ unit tests; `pnpm test:native` /
  `pnpm coverage:native` (lcov on Unix)
- `test/lib/util.ts` contains Vitest utilities
- Coverage: TypeScript in `coverage/`; native GTest in `coverage/native/`
- **No `tsx`**: `.ts`/`.mts` scripts, worker files, and `src` itself run under Node's native type
  stripping (the `engines` floor `^22.18.0 || >=24.0.0` is where it's unflagged). Rules for code Node
  loads directly (i.e. outside Vitest/tsdown, which do their own resolution):
  - **Real file extensions in every relative import.** `src` imports siblings as `./foo.ts`, not
    extensionless or `.js` — native strip does **not** remap `.js`→`.ts`. `allowImportingTsExtensions`
    - `noEmit` in `tsconfig.json` let `tsc` accept the `.ts` specifiers (tsdown ignores `noEmit` and
      still emits `dist`). This is why the unit-test worker `.mts` (`test/workers/`) and spawned-child
      `.mts` (`test/fixtures/`) import `../../src/index.ts` directly — so those tests need **no build
      step** (Vitest resolves its own `.js` specifiers; only the native-loaded files must use `.ts`).
      **Stress tests and benchmarks are the deliberate exception**: their workers import the built
      `dist` (`stress-test/workers/`, `benchmark/setup.ts`) because they exercise the shipped artifact,
      not source — so `pnpm test:stress` / `pnpm bench` build first (both CI workflows do).
  - **Mark type-only imports with `type`.** `verbatimModuleSyntax` is enabled: native strip can only
    erase `import type` / `import { type X }`, not a value-style `import { X }` that happens to be a
    type — that would survive to runtime and fail against a module (e.g. `dist`) that never exported
    the type. `tsc` enforces this.
  - **Fixture helpers must be `src`-free** only where they'd otherwise pull a heavier graph — e.g.
    `createWorkerBootstrapScript` lives in `test/lib/worker-bootstrap.ts` (no `src` import), separate
    from `test/lib/util.ts` (which imports `src`); every call site imports it directly.
- **GC is not exposed to Deno's test workers** (#770): tests that force collection run in Vitest's
  worker, not the process you launched. Node's `threads` pool inherits `--expose-gc` through
  `execArgv`, and Bun exposes `Bun.gc()`, but Deno uses the `forks` pool and
  `--v8-flags=--expose-gc` applies only to the CLI process it was passed to — so `globalThis.gc` is
  undefined in every Deno worker and each `skipIf(!globalThis.gc)` test silently skips there. Guard
  GC-dependent tests with `skipIf`, never with a throw. `DENO_V8_FLAGS=--expose-gc` is the fix (the
  environment is inherited by children) but cannot land until #771 is fixed: the restored coverage
  makes `test/lock.test.ts` and one macOS `verification-table.test.ts` case fail.

## Important Implementation Notes

1. **Key Encoding Order**: Always encode values before keys when using `sharedStructuresKey` to
   avoid overwriting shared key buffer
2. **Buffer Management**: Store uses reusable buffers for performance (`keyBuffer`, `encodeBuffer`)
3. **Memory Management**: Native layer handles RocksDB memory, TypeScript layer manages encoding
   buffers
4. **Error Handling**: C++ errors are translated to JavaScript exceptions via N-API
5. **Transaction log size is append-owned**: `TransactionLogFile::size` is the authoritative written
   extent, mutated only by the append path (and the one-time reopen correction before the first
   append). Read/index paths (e.g. `findPositionByTimestamp`) must never truncate it — a zero
   timestamp seen mid-index during concurrent appends is a not-yet-visible memory-map artifact, not
   EOF. Reads during writes are bounded by the committed position, not `size` (see
   `hasAppendedSinceOpen`; HarperFast/harper#1148). The other half of that contract is that
   an append that fails part-way (ENOSPC, a short write on a full volume) retires the segment
   without truncating it: `writeBatchToFile` reports the landed extent, `writeEntriesV1` marks
   any positive or unknown extent unappendable, and `TransactionLogStore::writeBatch` rotates
   it before propagating the error. The rotation is allowed only after the last safe logical
   extent has been written and synced to that segment's preallocated marker under
   `transaction_logs/.append-boundaries/<store>/`; retirement overwrites that fixed extent rather
   than extending it, and a filesystem that still cannot persist the overwrite fails closed instead
   of rotating. Initial creation writes and syncs a temporary marker before atomically publishing the
   final name, so neither a crash nor a concurrent opener can observe a short initialization. The
   marker carries a token and complemented boundary so a torn/corrupt marker fails load closed. On
   restart, registered files, readers, purge counting, backup snapshots, and strict validation all
   use the marked logical prefix and never expose the orphaned physical tail. The marker is not copied
   into backups: the copied prefix is already a clean canonical `.txnlog`.
   A known-zero-byte failure leaves the segment and its zero marker reusable.
   Only the **active** segment may have a marker _created_ for it (a retired segment keeps the one it
   already earned), and startup discovery cannot know which segment that is until the whole directory
   has been scanned — directory iteration order is unspecified, so any segment can briefly hold the
   highest sequence. `registerLogFile()` therefore registers without opening, and `load()`
   marker-enables and opens the surviving current file after discovery. Promoting eagerly minted a
   marker for a segment that is never appended to and, on Windows (where the handle is opened without
   `FILE_SHARE_DELETE`), left every superseded segment undeletable by anything outside the process for
   the life of the store.
   **The physical extent tracks `size` on POSIX only.** There the fd is `O_APPEND`,
   so writes go to physical EOF, not to `size`, and leaving orphaned bytes makes every later
   append land after a partial entry: a mid-file framing break that `recoverTail()` deliberately
   will not repair and every later read must resync past (invariant 11; HarperFast/rocksdb-js#748). On
   Windows `size` is the logical end of entries only — an active segment is pre-extended to
   `maxFileSize` with `SetEndOfFile` so it can be mapped (`getMemoryMapLocked`), its physical
   size stays `maxFileSize` for its whole life with a zero-padded tail, and end-of-entries is
   found by the zero-timestamp convention instead. Windows appends seek to `size` first, so an
   orphan is overwritten rather than skipped past — but a _shorter_ next batch would leave the
   orphan's stale bytes past its own end, reading as an entry instead of the marker, so retirement
   is the rule on both platforms. Transactions are never split across segments: a batch that does
   not fit rotates before writing, while one batch may exceed `transactionLogMaxSize` in an empty
   segment. This keeps a failed append from stranding an unflagged transaction prefix in an earlier
   file. Initialization owes the same discipline:
   a header write that lands short removes the file, since a size in `(0, HEADER_SIZE)` fails
   `open()`'s validity check on every future open and freeing disk space would not heal it.
6. **Shared DBDescriptor teardown is cross-env**: a `DBDescriptor` is process-global and shared by
   every env that opens the same path (`worker_threads` workers included), so multiple threads can
   reach `DBRegistry::CloseDB` for one descriptor at the same time — e.g. several worker envs tearing
   down at once, each via its own `Database` finalizer. The purge decision (refcount check),
   `descriptor->close()`, and the registry-map erase must therefore be coordinated under
   `databasesMutex` and must never dereference a raw pointer/iterator into the map across an unlocked
   region — a concurrent erase frees that node and the survivor closes a freed descriptor (locking a
   destroyed mutex; surfaces on glibc as "malloc(): unaligned tcache chunk detected"). The current
   design takes a `shared_ptr` copy of the descriptor under the lock as a single-purge claim (the copy
   pushes `use_count` past the purge threshold so a racing `CloseDB` skips) while leaving the entry in
   the map — descriptor non-null and `isClosing()` — until `close()` finishes, so a concurrent
   `OpenDB` keeps waiting on the entry's condition instead of re-opening the path mid-close. This
   purge tail lives in `DBRegistry::PurgeIfUnreferenced`. Async ops that pin the descriptor with
   their own `shared_ptr` for the duration of a copy (backup, backup stream, checkpoint) make a
   racing close skip the purge (`use_count > 1`), so their state destructors re-run
   `PurgeIfUnreferenced` after releasing the ref — without that retry the skipped purge is permanent
   and the entry (plus the open RocksDB) leaks (HarperFast/rocksdb-js#672). Once `beginClose()` wins,
   `DBHandle::opened()` must report false even while the native DB still exists. Any synchronous N-API
   path that dereferences `descriptor->db` or the handle's column family must take an `OperationGuard`
   immediately after `UNWRAP_DB_HANDLE_AND_OPEN()`; `finishClose()` can reset the column-family pointer
   from another env after the in-flight count drains. The VT-only `verifyVersion` / `populateVersion`
   fast paths narrow, but do not remove, that requirement: both still start with
   `UNWRAP_DB_HANDLE_AND_OPEN()`, so they still gate on `descriptor`/`isClosing()`. What
   `DBHandle::open()`'s snapshotted `verificationTableDbId` / `verificationTableColumnFamilyId` actually
   avoids is the `getColumnFamilyHandle()` dereference and the `OperationGuard`'s in-flight
   registration — the two things that are unsafe to skip everywhere else. `PutSync`/`RemoveSync`/
   `TransactionHandle` still compute the VT address as `descriptor->vtEpoch` +
   `getColumnFamilyHandle()->GetID()` rather than reading the cached fields, so there are two
   spellings of the same address computation that must stay in agreement.
   Async N-API setup must hold the guard until it hands off to `DBHandle::registerAsyncWork()`. Iterators
   take the guard through construction/descriptor attachment, then serialize each native iterator call
   against foreign forced close with their per-iterator mutex. `DBHandle::close()` itself is cross-env and must
   serialize mutation of its `shared_ptr` members. A close-time flush failure keeps the native DB
   quarantined so `shutdown()` can retry without losing `disableWAL` writes; an explicit destroy may
   force teardown because the caller requested deletion. A failed physical destroy leaves a registry
   tombstone, but `shutdown()` is deliberately non-destructive: it reports the tombstone and only an
   explicit `destroy()` retries path deletion. Physical deletion itself runs without `databasesMutex`
   held (deleting a large directory is I/O, and holding the registry lock across it would serialize
   every unrelated open/close in the process behind one path's removal); `destroyingPaths` — a
   path-keyed set guarded by its own `lifecycleCondition` — is what keeps a concurrent `OpenDB`/
   `Shutdown` from treating that path as free once its entries are already erased from the registry
   but the files are not yet gone.
   Because `finishClose()` drains `operationsInFlight` with an **untimed** wait, any operation that can
   run unboundedly while holding an `OperationGuard` must abort itself once `closing` is published, or
   it blocks teardown — and, since the blocked closer holds the path gate, times out every concurrent
   `OpenDB()` for that path. There are two such operations and they cancel differently: the whole-range
   count scan (`DBIteratorHandle::countRemaining`, behind `getKeysCount()` on both the database and
   transaction paths) polls `isClosing()` per row and reports the abort to its caller rather than a
   partial count; a manual `compactRange()` cannot poll from inside RocksDB, so it gets an explicit
   cancel token → `CompactRangeOptions::canceled`. There are **two** such tokens, and which one a
   compaction is handed is decided by the drain that awaits it, not by where the compaction runs.
   `DBDescriptor::compactCancelRequested` covers a **synchronous** `compactSync()`/`clearSync()`,
   which holds an `OperationGuard` for its whole duration and so is awaited by `finishClose()`'s
   untimed `operationsInFlight` wait; it is armed in exactly one place — `beginClose()`, in the same
   transition that publishes `closing`. `DBHandle::compactCancelRequested` covers an **async**
   `compact()`/`clear()`, which released its guard at setup handoff and is instead awaited by
   `DBHandle::close()`'s untimed async-work drain. It has **two** arming sites, one per closer:
   `DBHandle::close()` arms its own immediately before that drain, and `finishClose()` arms every
   still-attached handle's through `Closable::cancelBlockingWork()` before its _first_ blocking
   step. The second is not belt-and-braces. A foreign `destroy()`/`shutdown()` reaches the handle
   only through the closables sweep, which is the last step of teardown — and three earlier steps
   can each block on that compaction: the optional `compactOnClose` pass takes `compactMutex`,
   which the running compaction holds; `WaitForCompact()` does not return while a manual
   compaction runs; then the sweep's own drain waits it out. The closer holds the path gate
   throughout, so a late arm times out every concurrent `OpenDB()` for that path.
   The split between the two tokens is not redundancy either: a self-close (`db.close()` →
   `DBRegistry::CloseDB`) reaches `DBHandle::close()` **before** `PurgeIfUnreferenced`/`beginClose()`,
   so the descriptor token is not yet armed when the async drain starts — a `db.close()` racing its
   own `db.compact()` would park the JS thread for the compaction's full duration. Arming the
   descriptor token from `CloseDB` is not the alternative: it is never cleared, so one handle
   closing would permanently kill manual compaction for every other handle sharing the
   process-global descriptor. That is also what makes it safe for `finishClose()` to arm handles
   this thread does not own: the per-handle token _is_ cleared, by `DBRegistry::OpenDB()`, and only
   after the new descriptor is adopted (see invariant 27). Neither token is ever aliased onto
   `closing` itself: RocksDB writes through the pointer it is given
   (`DisableManualCompaction()` sets the caller's atomic), and `closing` means the registry has an
   owner committed to running `finishClose()`, which RocksDB must not be able to publish.
   `test/fixtures/fork-compact-cancel-{sync,async,close,destroy}.mts` cover the four close paths in
   the same order as above. What they pin down is **our** half of the contract — that the right
   token is armed, early enough, and handed to RocksDB: each fails if `options.canceled` stops
   being passed (the compaction then succeeds instead of returning `Incomplete`), `sync` also fails
   if the descriptor arm moves past the in-flight drain, and the `destroy` fixture (which drives its
   foreign closer through `shutdown()`, not `destroy()` — a `destroy()`-driven closer skips
   `compactOnClose` entirely, per the flush/compaction skip below, removing the only step that
   blocks on `compactMutex` and making early-vs-late arm timing indistinguishable) also fails if the
   foreign arm moves back to the closables sweep. They do **not** exercise RocksDB aborting a compaction
   already in progress: `ROCKSDB_JS_COMPACT_DELAY_MS` parks before `CompactRange`, deliberately, so
   the fixtures do not depend on how long a real compaction runs. Nor does any of them separate
   arming in `beginClose()` from arming at the top of `finishClose()` — for a single descriptor
   those are equivalent, and what makes `beginClose()` the right home is that `DestroyDB`/`Shutdown`
   claim every entry for a path under one lock and then close them sequentially.
   Everything the four registry teardown paths do _after_ claiming a descriptor —
   `finishClose()`, erase-or-quarantine, notify, emit `database:closeFailed` — is one helper,
   `closeClaimedDescriptors` in `db_registry.cpp`; only the claim predicate differs per caller. Its
   `failOnCompletedWithError` option is the one deliberate asymmetry: a close that finished native
   teardown but reported an error (a failed close-time flush) is fatal for `shutdown()`/`PurgeAll()`
   because dropping it silently would hide possible data loss, and non-fatal for `destroy()`, whose
   caller asked for the data to be deleted anyway.

   **`databasesMutex` covers the registry map, not a descriptor's own maps.** `registryStatus()`
   walks every entry under it and then reaches into each descriptor, but `columns` is guarded by
   `columnsMutex` and `locks` by `locksMutex` — both mutated from whichever thread drives a
   `dropSync()` (`retireColumnFamily`) or a teardown (`finishClose()`'s `columns.clear()`,
   `lockReleaseByOwner`), which for a cross-env `destroy()`/`shutdown()` is not the thread
   reporting. Walking `columns` unguarded is a use-after-free, not a torn count: the map node is
   freed while the loop still holds its key, and `napi_set_named_property()` `strlen()`s that key
   (SIGSEGV, or a `std::bad_alloc` abort from a garbage length). Snapshot value-only data under
   `databasesMutex` and each owning mutex, release them all, then build the JS values — holding a
   mutex across N-API calls risks a finalizer re-entering it on this thread, while carrying a
   `shared_ptr<DBDescriptor>` past `databasesMutex` makes a racing last-handle close see
   `use_count() > 1` and skip its purge permanently (the pin has no release-side retry).
   `transactions` follows the same copy-under-`txnsMutex` pattern; `events.size()` locks internally.

   A self-close must detach from `closables` **after** it closes, not before: `DBRegistry::CloseDB`
   and the `NativeIterator`/iterator finalizer each own a handle/iterator that a foreign
   `destroy()`/`shutdown()` can also try to claim, and detaching first makes that foreign closer's
   sweep skip this one entirely — it drains `operationsInFlight` (already zero: an admitted async
   `Flush`/`Compact`/`Get` releases its `OperationGuard` at setup handoff, per invariant 17) and
   reaches `db.reset()`/`iterator::Reset()` while the self-close's own async-work drain, or the
   `Next()` in progress, is still using the DB. Detaching after close() returns costs nothing on the
   ordinary path — a foreign close arriving in that window blocks on the same `closeMutex`/
   `iteratorMutex`, finds nothing left to do once it acquires it, and moves on — and it makes
   `close()` itself the single point every teardown source waits on.

7. **One writable BackupEngine per backup directory (kernel advisory lock)**: each backup op opens its
   own short-lived `rocksdb::BackupEngine`/`BackupEngineReadOnly` (`src/binding/database/backup.cpp`), and
   RocksDB only serializes work _within_ a single engine — it has no cross-engine lock on the directory.
   Two writers on the same directory (two `db.backup()` calls, or a `backup` racing a `delete`/`purge`),
   in the same process or different ones, collide on the per-backup staging dir and both fail,
   potentially leaving zero usable backups. A single writer is enforced by holding a non-blocking
   exclusive OS advisory lock on the `.backup.lock` file at the directory root — `flock` on POSIX,
   `LockFileEx` on Windows. Backup creation acquires it natively inside `Database::Backup`
   (`runCreateBackup` in `src/binding/database/backup.cpp`), which first creates the backup directory
   (with missing parents); `backups.delete` and `backups.purge` acquire the same lock from JS via
   `withBackupDirLock` in `src/backup.ts`, which first rejects a missing backup directory with a
   clear error — `tryFileLock` itself creates missing parents, so without that explicit check a
   `delete` on a typo'd path would conjure an empty directory. The lock is taken **entirely in
   native code** (`tryAcquireFileLock` / `releaseFileLock` in `src/binding/core/file_lock.cpp`,
   exposed generically as the binding's `tryFileLock`/`fileLockRelease` — a public utility API, not
   backup-specific): native opens the file,
   locks it, and later closes its OS handle, returning only an opaque uint32 token to JS. **No descriptor
   crosses the JS boundary** — this is deliberate: the addon
   statically links its own C runtime (`binding.gyp` `RuntimeLibrary: 0` = `/MT`), so a Node/libuv fd is
   not resolvable here and `_get_osfhandle` on such an fd fast-fails the process (`0xC0000409` on Windows).
   The kernel owns the lock, so there is **no staleness heuristic**: it is released when the handle closes —
   normal release, crash, `kill -9`, container exit — and a dead holder can never wedge the directory. (An
   earlier pidfile design broke in containers: pid liveness is meaningless across pid namespaces — every
   container has a pid 1 — and pidfile reclaim races are only fully eliminated by OS locks.) The lock
   conflicts per _open file description_, so it excludes across processes, containers sharing a volume
   (same kernel), and `worker_threads` — an in-memory lock cannot. It does **not** coordinate across
   hosts: `flock` on many network filesystems (NFS `local_lock`, CIFS, 9p) is node-local, so two hosts
   sharing a backup volume can both acquire — a caller-managed hazard the old pidfile also could not
   prevent (its reclaim used host-local pid liveness). On filesystems that don't implement `flock` at
   all (`EOPNOTSUPP`/`ENOTSUP` — e.g. the FUSE/9p mounts behind Docker Desktop bind mounts on
   macOS/Windows), native **degrades to a no-op "acquired"** rather than making backups impossible:
   cross-writer protection is forfeited only where it was unattainable. Native opens the handle with
   `O_CLOEXEC` (POSIX) / non-inheritable (Windows) so a spawned child can't inherit it and hold the lock
   past release. On Windows the locked byte sits far past EOF because Windows range locks are mandatory and
   would otherwise block a contender from reading the file. The file is **never unlinked** — unlink-on-
   release races a concurrent acquirer holding a handle to the removed inode (two "winners" on different
   inodes); an unlocked, empty `.backup.lock` is the steady state. Contention **rejects**; it does not queue, so a caller issuing
   overlapping backups to one directory must handle the "locked" error (e.g. retry).
   `backups.restore` holds the same lock in **shared** mode (`tryFileLock(file, true)` → `flock`
   `LOCK_SH` / `LockFileEx` without `LOCKFILE_EXCLUSIVE_LOCK`) for its source read: concurrent
   restores coexist, but a writer racing a restore rejects instead of deleting the files the restore
   is copying — the asymmetry matters because the default `purgeAllFiles` restore mode wipes the
   destination before copying, so a restore failed mid-purge leaves no usable database while a
   rejected writer just retries. A restore is pure-read (`BackupEngineReadOnly` + copy out), so the
   shared path must not require write access to the backup directory: it opens the lock file
   **read-only** and never creates it (the exclusive path still opens read-write / creates), letting
   a restore lock an existing `.backup.lock` on an immutable/WORM or read-only-mounted backup store.
   If even the read-only open fails because the media is read-only for **every** process (`EROFS` on
   POSIX, `ERROR_WRITE_PROTECT` on Windows), the shared lock **degrades to a no-op "acquired"** rather
   than hard-failing the restore — the same reasoning as the `flock`-unsupported degrade: no writer
   can exist on a directory nothing can write, so the lock would protect nothing there. Permission
   denial (`EACCES`/`EPERM`, `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`) is deliberately **not** degraded: it means only
   the _calling_ identity is blocked, so a more-privileged writer (e.g. a `purge` running as the
   service account that created the backup) could still hold a real exclusive lock — degrading there
   would let a lesser-privileged restore silently read a directory mid-purge. Those cases hard-fail.
   (Exclusive acquisition has no degrade either — writers legitimately need write access and hard-fail.)
   The remaining read-only ops (`list`, `verify`) are not locked since
   concurrent readers are safe (and locking them would make cheap listings reject during a long
   backup); a `list`/`verify` racing a `delete`/`purge` is a caller-managed hazard. Different
   directories are independent (separate lock files) and run fully in parallel.
8. **Backup disk-space preflight is conservative and best-effort**: directory-target `db.backup()`
   preflights the destination volume before taking the writer lock (`checkBackupDiskSpace` in
   `src/binding/database/backup_disk_space.cpp`, defaulted on via the `checkDiskSpace` option). It is
   extracted into a Node-free translation unit **so a GoogleTest can exercise it** — N-API TUs can't
   link into the native-test target — with a `rocksdb::Env*` param a fake env overrides in tests. The
   required size is deliberately the _full_ live-file footprint (`GetLiveFilesStorageInfo`, summed) plus
   the transaction-log snapshot bytes when `transactionLogs` is set (those write to the same volume but
   aren't RocksDB live files) plus the current memtable when flushing — never the incremental delta,
   because a backup only ever _copies_ files, so full size can't under-estimate the bytes written. It
   therefore over-rejects incrementals to tight volumes (opt out with `checkDiskSpace:false`) and, like
   the backup lock, **degrades to a skip** where the answer is untrustworthy: `GetFreeSpace`
   unsupported/errored or reporting 0 (which also lets a genuinely-full local volume through — a real 0
   is indistinguishable from the spurious 0 some network filesystems report). The stream-target backup
   path never opens a `BackupEngine` against a volume and is not checked.
9. **Transactional reads are database-wide, but async column-family pins end before teardown**:
   a RocksDB transaction can read any column family in its database, so a read issued through another
   `RocksDatabase` must use that caller's `ColumnFamilyDescriptor`, not the transaction's original
   `DBHandle`. Register setup briefly against the caller's `DBHandle` before copying its descriptor,
   so a cross-environment close cannot reset the descriptor between the open check and the pin. The
   transaction itself must be registered before inspecting `txn`/state, then that registration is
   transferred to the queued async state; failed N-API setup must release refs/work/state without
   double-unregistering or retaining the descriptor.
   cold-cache async path then pins that descriptor in `AsyncGetState` while the worker uses its native
   column-family handle, and resets the pin **before** `signalExecuteCompleted()`; that
   signal can unblock transaction/database close, which destroys column families before the RocksDB
   database. Do not retain a raw/native column-family handle into the N-API completion callback or
   inspect a concurrently closing `DBHandle` from the worker. Transactional count iterators must also
   pass the transaction snapshot through `ReadOptions`; `disableSnapshot` intentionally leaves it null
   so counts observe the latest committed state.
10. **Retained memtable history must fit the WriteBufferManager budget**: `max_write_buffer_size_to_maintain`
    is a floor, not a cap — RocksDB trims history back down to it and never below — and that memory is
    charged to the process-wide WriteBufferManager. A target above the manager's budget therefore fills
    the budget with memory that is never released, and a manager built with `allowStall` stalls every
    write to that database permanently rather than until a flush catches up; without `allowStall` the
    same history is simply never reclaimed, so the budget stops bounding what it exists to bound.
    `buildColumnFamilyOptions` resolves the derived (`-1`) default to **1** whenever a manager is
    configured at all (`resolveMaxWriteBufferSizeToMaintain`) — deliberately not only when it is a
    stalling one, because `allowStall` is mutable at runtime (`DBSettings::Config` propagates it
    through `SetAllowStall`) while this target is immutable once the family exists, so keying the
    clamp on it would leave every family created before the switch permanently unprotected.

    **It must never be 0, which is the value that reads as safe and behaves as the worst case.** Every
    writable open here goes through a transaction wrapper, and both of them rewrite a 0 target to `-1`
    before `DB::Open` sees it (`OptimisticTransactionDB::Open`, `TransactionDB::PrepareWrap` in RocksDB
    v11.8.1); `SanitizeOptions` then expands `-1` to `max_write_buffer_number * write_buffer_size`, i.e.
    256MB per column family with this codebase's defaults. Only families created _after_ an open — via
    `DB::CreateColumnFamily`, which has no such rewrite — kept the 0, which is why the fresh-database
    stall test passed while the safeguard never survived a restart in production (rocksdb-js#821,
    harper#2490). An explicit caller 0 is normalized for the same reason; an explicit **positive** value
    is honored as given, and sizing it against the budget and the column-family count is then the
    caller's job.

    1 is not "no history". `MemTableListVersion::TrimHistory` compares against
    `MemoryAllocatedBytesExcludingLast()`, which excludes the entry it is about to drop, so the newest
    flushed memtable is retained until that family's next write schedules a trim (`CheckMemtableFull` →
    `trim_history_scheduler_`, drained by `DBImpl::PreprocessWrite` **before** its `ShouldStall` check).
    The bound is one flushed memtable per family instead of 256MB per family, and no positive target
    does better — the residual is independent of the target's magnitude, so a budget smaller than
    `familyCount * writeBufferSize` can still wedge. `DBDescriptor::open` reports a configuration whose
    known families' targets already reach the budget to registered `log.warn` listeners; without one,
    the open-time report is not retained. When stalls are enabled, an actual continuous stall is still
    written to `stderr` by the stall watchdog unless `ROCKSDB_JS_WBM_STALL_WARN_MS=0`. The open-time
    report is not a guarantee, because families are created lazily and only the ones present at that
    open are counted.

    The general trap: `DBOptions` defaults that derive a large value were sized when they reached one
    column family, so widening where an option applies means re-checking its default against every
    shared budget it competes for. The second trap is this one — a sentinel that means "unset" to the
    layer below turns your safe value into its default.

11. **A corrupt transaction-log frame ends an entry, not the log**: framing breaks come in two
    shapes and the reader must not conflate them. A **torn tail** has nothing valid behind it, so
    the break is genuinely end-of-log — that is what `recoverTail()` truncates at open. A **mid-log
    break** (a partial `ENOSPC`/`EDQUOT` append the process survived) has intact, already-committed
    entries appended _after_ it; `recoverTail()` deliberately leaves such a file alone rather than
    discard them, and rotated files are never rescanned at all. `query()` therefore reports the
    break as a `CorruptFrameError` carrying `resyncPosition` (where framing resumes, per the same
    heuristic as `findFramingResumeOffset()`) and **leaves iteration positioned there**, so a caller
    that calls `next()` again recovers the entries past it. Treating the throw as terminal amputates
    every later entry in the file permanently — each drain restarts from the same resume cursor and
    re-throws at the same offset, which is how HarperFast/harper#2016 lost 2.2 days of acknowledged
    writes and #2063 starved a replication stream for 11 days. Keep `RESYNC_MIN_FRAMES` in
    `transaction-log-reader.ts` and `transaction_log_recovery.cpp` in step.

    The engine owes the same discipline, or the reader's resync is moot. Every native walk of the
    framing — the open-time recovery scan and `findPositionByTimestamp`'s index walk — resumes at
    `findFramingResumeOffset()` instead of stopping at the break, so the committed-read watermark
    (`lastCompleteTransactionEnd`, which may therefore exceed `validEnd` for `MidFileCorruption`)
    and the timestamp index both cover the entries past it. Stopping at the break clamped every
    committed read to the entries _before_ it (39 of 60 rows reached the replica) and froze the index
    so every seek at or after the break reported "past this file". Striding through a broken frame's
    declared length is never an in-flight append: `size` is bumped only after the bytes land, so a
    nonzero header below `size` is a complete entry and a length overrunning it is a break.

    The resync scan must be bounded by the **written extent** (`getLogFileSize`, which returns the
    append-owned `TransactionLogFile::size` — see invariant 5 — not the physical or mapped size).
    An uncommitted read's own limit is the pre-extended memory map, and every offset in that zero
    fill reads as an end-of-entries marker: scanning against it both loses the exact-end signal and,
    if a zero were taken as a terminator, would let a chain "end" anywhere in megabytes of padding.
    Resolve it only on a break — `getLogFileSize` crosses into native and takes the store mutex, so
    a per-frame call would tax every healthy read. The native walks run before `size` has been
    corrected on a pre-extended (Windows) segment, so `findFramingResumeOffset()` also accepts a
    chain landing exactly on the **end of the nonzero bytes** — a single offset, as conclusive as
    EOF — otherwise a run shorter than `RESYNC_MIN_FRAMES` in front of the padding classifies as a
    torn tail and recovery truncates its committed entries.

    A resync that finds nothing is only conclusive over the bytes it could actually read. The index
    walk searches the mapped region (`min(size, mapSize)`), which is short of the written extent
    whenever one batch exceeded `transactionLogMaxSize` or the limit was lowered, so an empty result
    there means "not in this map", not "not in this file". It must then stay at the break and report
    an unindexed tail — the same treatment the walk already gives a header the map does not cover —
    and only park `lastIndexedPosition` at the written extent when the whole extent was searchable
    and the break is therefore a torn tail. A short map also disqualifies the "chain lands on the
    written extent" signal (`endIsWrittenExtent`): the region ends on an arbitrary cut, so a chain
    landing there proves nothing, and accepting one lets a garbage chain in the corrupt gap pass as
    the resume — whose bogus timestamp then caps this running-maxima index and hides every real
    entry behind it. The frame-run signal is the only one left. Skipping to the extent is permanent: a later, larger map
    resumes from `lastIndexedPosition` and never looks below it, so those entries stay unindexed and
    every seek into them reports "past this file". Staying at the break costs nothing per seek: the
    extent that failed is remembered (`resyncSearchedExtent`), since only a larger map can change
    the answer and the byte-wise search spans the whole corrupt gap under the store's
    `dataSetsMutex`.

12. **Coordinated retry parks on a lock, bounded by a descriptor-owned timeout**: a `coordinatedRetry`
    commit that loses a conflict (`IsBusy`) parks instead of rejecting immediately —
    `completeCommitWork` (`src/binding/transaction/transaction.cpp`) registers a wake callback on the
    conflicting VT slot's `LockTracker` (via `addWakeCallback`) and resolves `RETRY_NOW` only when
    that lock's last holder releases (`VerificationTable::releaseWriteIntent` → `LockTracker::wake`).
    A holder that never releases — a leaked/abandoned transaction, or a wake lost to a bug elsewhere —
    would otherwise park forever (harper#2001: a worker's write path disabled for 5+ hours until
    restart). `ParkTimeoutRegistry` (`db_descriptor.{h,cpp}`) bounds this with
    `ROCKSDB_JS_PARK_TIMEOUT_MS` (default `5000` — the top of this fix's requested 2-5s range, to
    leave maximum headroom for a holder that is merely slow rather than abandoned, since a timeout
    consumes a `coordinatedRetry` attempt exactly like a real wake does and `maxRetries` is finite):
    one registry, and one lazily-started timeout thread, **per descriptor** — joined at
    `finishClose()` (and again, idempotently, from the destructor as a safety net, matching
    `commitWorker`) — tracks every outstanding deadline instead of spawning a thread per park (the
    contention path is exactly where an abandoned holder makes parks dense, so per-park threads would
    be a resource cliff, not a fix). Deliberately a plain `std::thread`, not a `uv_timer_t`: this addon
    ships one prebuilt binary across Node ABI versions via N-API, and libuv's struct layout is not part
    of that stable surface.

    **A `LockTracker` wake callback runs under the process-global VT `writerMutex_`, so it must not
    block and must not re-enter the VT or `DBRegistry`.** `LockTracker::wake()` invokes its callbacks
    inline and both callers (`releaseWriteIntent`, `cancelForDB`) hold that mutex across the whole
    function. Re-entering the registry from there self-deadlocks: `DBRegistry::PurgeIfUnreferenced`
    can claim the purge and call `finishClose()` → `cancelForDB()` → a second lock of the same
    non-recursive `writerMutex_`, wedging every database's write-intent path process-wide — the exact
    symptom this note exists to fix. It is also an AB-BA against `finishClose`'s `txnsMutex` →
    `writerMutex_` order, and it would run a flush, a manual compaction, `WaitForCompact` and thread
    joins under the global VT lock. That is why `ParkTimeoutRegistry` is a standalone object owned by
    the descriptor through a `shared_ptr` rather than state on the descriptor itself: the wake closure
    captures a **`std::weak_ptr<ParkTimeoutRegistry>`** and calls only `fire(id)`, which touches one
    mutex and one map. Weak, not raw, because a park can end up registered on a tracker installed by a
    _different_ database on a colliding VT slot (`VerificationTable::lockSlotForWrite` joins an existing
    tracker without retagging its `dbId`), so that lock's eventual release wakes a park whose own
    database may already have closed — `cancelForDB()` only wakes trackers tagged with _its own_
    `vtEpoch`, so it cannot be relied on to have resolved a foreign-`dbId` park first. Weak **to the
    registry and not to the descriptor** because a `weak_ptr<DBDescriptor>::lock()` is a transient extra
    reference, and `PurgeIfUnreferenced` decides on `use_count() <= 1`: a racing close would see the
    inflated count, skip the purge, and leak the registry entry plus the open RocksDB — the
    HarperFast/rocksdb-js#672 hazard, which the wake path cannot repair by retrying the purge (that is
    the re-entrancy above). `.lock()` failing is the expected outcome once the owning database closes:
    `ParkTimeoutRegistry::shutdown()` (called from `finishClose()` right after `cancelForDB`, before
    the descriptor can be destroyed) unconditionally resolves every park it still holds regardless of
    whether the real holder ever wakes it, so by the time the weak reference can fail, the park has
    already settled.

    Each park is identified by a monotonic `uint64_t id`, not its entry's address: `LockTracker::wakeCallbacks`
    has no removal API (see the gap noted below), so a stale closure can outlive its entry, and an
    address-keyed lookup risks resolving a _different_, later park that reused the same freed heap
    address. The timeout thread and the LockTracker wake callback race through one heap-allocated
    `std::atomic<bool>` per park (independent of the per-park `RetryNowContext`, whose refs/TSFN the
    winning side's release eventually frees) — whichever fires first calls+releases the TSFN under the
    registry's `mutex` and erases the entry; the loser finds it already gone and touches nothing. That
    same mutex is what a dying env's `releaseByEnv` (wired into the module env-cleanup
    hook next to `ReleaseCommitCompletionsByEnv`) takes to cancel — release without calling — that
    env's pending parks before Node frees their tsfns; `retryNowCallJs` also guards `env == nullptr`
    like `commitCompletionCallJs` does, for the same tsfn-queue-drained-during-teardown reason. Parks
    are indexed twice, by id and by deadline (`std::multimap`): `fire()` needs an O(1) lookup because it
    runs under the global VT mutex, and the timeout thread needs the earliest deadline on every wakeup
    without an O(N) scan on that same lock. Known gap: `LockTracker::wakeCallbacks`
    itself has no removal API. Before this change an abandoned holder accrued one inert callback per
    waiter and then everything hung; now each waiter re-parks (and re-registers) every
    `ROCKSDB_JS_PARK_TIMEOUT_MS` up to `maxRetries`, so registrations accumulate per _retry_ rather than
    per incident for as long as it lasts (each is inert once its own park resolves, so this is a
    memory-growth concern, not a correctness one) — deferred rather than risking an unreviewed change to
    `verification_table.cpp`'s concurrency invariants under this fix's scope.

13. **A dropped transaction must release itself**: `DBDescriptor::transactionAdd` holds a **strong**
    `shared_ptr` (the parallel `closables` entry is weak), so the registry alone keeps a
    `TransactionHandle` alive and `~TransactionHandle` — hence `close()`, the only `ClearSnapshot()`
    path — is unreachable while it is registered. The `NativeTransaction` finalizer therefore calls
    `onWrapperCollected()` before dropping its reference: once V8 has collected the wrapper, no JS
    code can commit, abort, retry, or read through that handle again, so it is closed. The one
    exception is `state == Committing`, where `TransactionCommitState` still owns the handle and
    closing would cancel a commit mid-flight; the commit-completion paths close it instead — success
    always closes, and the failure paths (which deliberately leave the handle open for a caller that
    may retry) check `wrapperCollected`, because there is no caller left. Other dependents defer the
    orphan close without blocking the V8 finalizer: a cold-cache async get owns a
    `shared_ptr<TransactionHandle>` and retries after its async registration is released, while a
    transaction-backed `DBIteratorHandle` owns the handle and keeps `activeIteratorCount` nonzero
    until the RocksDB iterator is reset. The last dependent closes the orphan. Without this a dropped
    transaction either pinned `rocksdb.oldest-snapshot-time` for the life of the process or, after
    orphan cleanup was added, could be destroyed under an async read/live iterator
    (HarperFast/harper#2107; `test/transaction-orphan-gc.test.ts`). Two constraints on any redesign
    here: the registry reference cannot simply be made weak, because dependents need the coordinated
    cancellation and transaction-destruction path in `close()`; and `registryStatus()` may only report
    handle fields that are fixed before publication (`id`, `createdAt`), because `txnsMutex` covers
    map membership while mutable-field writers hold no lock.

14. **A recovered active transaction-log file ends on a transaction boundary when recovery can
    prove one**: only a batch's final entry
    carries `TRANSACTION_LOG_ENTRY_LAST_FLAG`, so a crash mid-batch leaves whole, well-framed
    entries that are a _prefix_ of a transaction. `recoverTail()` discards them
    (`discardUnclosedTransaction`) rather than leaving them for the committed watermark to step
    around: kept bytes are only invisible until the next commit moves the watermark past them, and
    then that batch's flag closes the phantom group — two source transactions merged into one for
    anything grouping on the flag. Discarding is safe because `writeBatch()` completes before
    `Transaction::Commit()` in every commit path and both commit-thread lanes preserve dispatch
    order, so an interrupted log write is always the newest thing in the log and its RocksDB commit
    never ran. Recovery walks entry headers via positional reads (never a whole-file buffer);
    payload bytes are skipped. Discarding is gated on proof that the writer sets the flag — a
    boundary earlier in the same file — plus a single timestamp across the trailing run. Callers can
    assign repeated timestamps,
    but an earlier transaction would still carry its own flag and reset the run. Without that proof
    the bytes are kept and warned about: a legacy batch split across a rotation has no boundary in
    the active file, and a log written before the flag existed would otherwise be truncated wholesale.
    Recovery reads `txn.state` before repairing the active file and never truncates below its
    same-file flushed offset: a missing flag can be media corruption on a batch RocksDB already
    absorbed, not proof that the commit never ran.
    `TransactionLogStore::load()` seeds from the latest proved boundary, walking backward across
    legacy rotation-spanning batches until it reaches a boundary or the `txn.state` floor, so recovery never
    hides entries already absorbed by RocksDB. Both platforms truncate; Windows first drops the cached
    mapping because mapped ranges prevent `SetEndOfFile` from shrinking the file. Windows uses the same
    physical truncation when the scan detects a torn tail, but its pre-extended zero padding makes an
    entry with a durable header and partially durable payload look complete; detecting that case needs
    a payload checksum. When Windows cannot shrink the file at all — sections there are mandatory, so
    any mapping this code does not own (a reader's handout, another process) blocks `SetEndOfFile` —
    a torn tail is zero-filled over `[validEnd, size)` instead (`zeroTailLocked`), restoring the
    zero-timestamp end-of-entries marker. Leaving those bytes is not benign: appends resume at `size`,
    so a later shorter batch would leave the stale bytes reading as an entry. POSIX has no such
    fallback and needs none — `ftruncate` ignores mappings, and the `O_APPEND` fd makes an in-place
    rewrite land at EOF anyway. Recovery runs before mappings can be handed to readers. A zero-fill
    that itself fails retires the segment rather than leaving it appendable, and retirement ends at
    the same transaction boundary a repair would erase to (`unclosedTransactionBoundary`, shared by
    both paths): the marker is a retired segment's only eraser, so an unclosed prefix left inside its
    logical extent would be closed by the _next_ segment's first flagged batch — the cross-rotation
    merge this invariant forbids.
15. **A callback-style native method owes its caller exactly one settled callback on every path**:
    `Flush` and `Compact` take `resolve`/`reject` and used to `return` on a read-only database
    without invoking either, so `await db.flush()` there never resumed (#774). The sync siblings can
    early-return — for a promise, "return" is not a no-op, it is a permanent hang with no error, no
    log line and a fully live event loop. Any new early return (guard, unsupported mode, cancelled
    work) added ahead of the `napi_create_async_work` call must settle first. The `napi_cancelled`
    branch in each `complete` callback is the same shape and is only unreachable because nothing
    calls `napi_cancel_async_work`.
16. **`FlushOptions::allow_write_stall` defaults to the waiting behavior, and the name reads
    backwards**: false (the RocksDB default, and what `flush()`/`flushSync()` still use unless a
    caller opts out) means the flush _waits_ until it can run without causing a write stall. The
    wait is unbounded and is taken on the calling thread — a libuv worker for the async `flush()` —
    so a database in a stall condition (immutable-memtable backlog, L0 stop trigger,
    pending-compaction-bytes limit, an exhausted WriteBufferManager budget, see invariant 10) yields
    a promise that never settles while the event loop stays alive — and parks the whole libuv
    worker, not just that promise: the threadpool defaults to 4 threads, so a handful of
    concurrently stalled flushes exhausts it and stalls every unrelated `fs`/`dns`/`crypto` call and
    cold-cache `get()` in the process. Do not confuse it with the
    `writeBufferManagerAllowStall` config: that decides whether the WriteBufferManager may stall
    writers at all, this decides whether one manual flush is willing to cause a stall rather than
    wait one out. The general trap is the same as invariant 10's — a default that encodes "wait for
    a good moment" is a hang whenever the good moment never arrives. `DBDescriptor::close()` is the
    obvious candidate to opt in — it has stopped accepting work, so a stall costs it nothing — and
    it is **not** opted in, on purpose: opting in makes the flush switch memtables immediately
    rather than waiting, which fires `OnFlushBegin`/`OnFlushCompleted` into transaction log stores
    that a concurrent `purgeLogs({destroy:true})` may be destroying, and that crashed a vitest
    worker on Bun/Windows (`transaction-log.test.ts`, "should write to same log from multiple
    workers"). So close can still wedge on a stall; fixing that has to happen without flushing into
    the teardown race. Still
    uncovered: `flushBeforeBackup` (`src/binding/database/backup.cpp`) flushes inside RocksDB's
    `BackupEngine`, which builds its own default `FlushOptions` we cannot reach — and that wait is
    taken _after_ the exclusive `.backup.lock` is acquired, so a stalled database turns a backup
    into an indefinite hang that also blocks every other backup/delete/purge on that directory
    until the process dies. Opting a flush in is also database-wide: it covers every column family
    on a process-global descriptor shared across `worker_threads`, so the stall reaches every
    handle on that path, not just the caller's. It is not a rescue for a flush already in flight —
    there is no cancellation — and forcing the memtable switch can itself prolong an L0 stop-trigger
    condition rather than clear it, so opt in up front rather than reaching for it mid-hang. It
    relocates the hang rather than removing it, too:
    a stalled `db->Write()` blocks whichever thread calls it, and for a committing transaction that
    is the descriptor's single `CommitWorker` thread (see "Commit execution" above), which dispatches
    every `Transaction.commit()` in order — so opting a flush into a stall queues up every commit
    behind it, including ones from callers that never touched flush.

17. **Async-work admission and cancellation share one mutex; the drain that follows must never time
    out**: `AsyncWorkHandle` (`napi/async.h`) tracks in-flight async work per `DBHandle`/
    `TransactionHandle`. `registerAsyncWork()` and `cancelAllAsyncWork()` both take `waitMutex`, so a
    registration that races a close either lands (and is counted) before cancellation publishes, or
    is refused — there is no window where it is admitted after `waitForAsyncWorkCompletion()` has
    already observed the count at zero. Refusal returns `false`; every call site (the shared
    `admitAsyncWorkOrReject()` helper, or the equivalent inline check in `transaction_handle.cpp`)
    must fail the operation — reject the already-constructed promise and touch no native state —
    rather than proceed with work nothing is tracking anymore. `waitForAsyncWorkCompletion()` itself
    has no timeout: `DBHandle::close()` / `TransactionHandle::close()` call it immediately before
    releasing the `rocksdb::DB`, column family, or transaction that admitted work may still be using,
    and a flush legitimately waiting out a write stall (invariant 16) can run far longer than any
    fixed bound. A bounded wait that gives up anyway — a fixed timeout with a "leak instead of free"
    fallback — would let `finishClose()` reach `this->db.reset()` while a flush was still executing
    against it, a genuine use-after-free. `database.cpp`'s `Flush`/`Compact`/`Clear`/async `Get` rely
    entirely on this drain for safety: their `OperationGuard` from `ACQUIRE_OPERATIONS_LOCK()` covers
    only the synchronous setup, not the queued execute callback. Backup/checkpoint/backup-stream
    additionally hold the descriptor's `operationsInFlight` claim through their whole async execution
    (the pinning pattern from invariant 9), so for those this drain is defense in depth rather than
    the only thing preventing a use-after-free.

18. **An env's pending transactions are reaped by its cleanup hook — never by `DBHandle::close()`**:
    `transactionAdd` stores a strong `shared_ptr<TransactionHandle>` in the process-global
    `DBDescriptor`, and only commit/abort call `transactionRemove` (the JS wrap finalizer drops
    the JS-side ref and, per invariant 13, `onWrapperCollected()` reaps a transaction whose
    _wrapper_ was GC'd while its env is still alive). That finalizer path does not cover the
    distinct case this invariant addresses: a worker **env that exits with a transaction still
    pending** — the wrapper was never collected, the env is dying. Such a handle — holding a live
    RocksDB transaction + snapshot, with its owning `DBHandle`'s `env` about to dangle — leaked
    into the shared descriptor, and the last env's
    `DBRegistry::Shutdown → finishClose → close()` then walked those corpses and corrupted the
    glibc heap (production signatures: `corrupted size vs. prev_size`,
    `corrupted double-linked list`, `free(): invalid pointer`; HarperFast/rocksdb-js#741 —
    reproduced 10/10 on Linux/glibc by `test/lingering-txn-shutdown.test.ts`, 10/10 clean with
    the fix). The reap is
    `DBRegistry::CloseTransactionsByEnv` → `DBDescriptor::closeTransactionsByEnv`, wired into the
    module's per-env cleanup hook (binding.cpp) so it runs on the dying env's own thread while the
    env is still valid. Both reap paths funnel through the same idempotent `close()`
    (`closed` gate) + idempotent `transactionRemove`, so a handle reachable by both the finalizer
    and this hook is closed exactly once.

    **Do not "simplify" this into `DBHandle::close()`.** A user-called `db.close()` runs with live
    microtasks: `db.transaction()` awaits its callback before committing, so a legitimate commit
    is routinely one microtask behind the close and must still reach the native layer (that
    close-then-commit overlap is exactly what `test/txn-close-commit-uaf.test.ts` exercises).
    Reaping at handle close rejects those commits with "Database not open" — and under Deno's
    scheduling it stranded the caller's commit promise entirely (CI hang on all three Deno
    platforms). At env teardown no such continuation can exist, so the hook is the only safe reap
    point. Between a user `db.close()` and env death, an open transaction's handle intentionally
    lingers (bounded, cleaned at env exit).

    Relatedly, `TransactionHandle::close()` is deliberately **napi-free** — the transaction holds
    no `napi_env`/`napi_ref` fields (the JS database is passed to `UseLog` per-call; its former
    weak `jsDatabaseRef` plus a recycled-pthread `std::thread::id` collision in close()'s
    thread-identity guard was the Linux corrupting write:
    `napi_delete_reference(dead env, dead ref)` from Shutdown). Close is therefore safe from any
    thread and any teardown phase; do not
    reintroduce napi calls into close paths. Known macOS-only artifact: under Guard Malloc the
    leaker repro still faults in Node's second-pass napi finalizer drain even with the fix; it
    never reproduces natively or on glibc, so the repro test is `skipIf(darwin)` (and, like the
    repo's other teardown repros, gated to Node).

    `DBHandle::close()` cannot be made napi-free the same way — closing a database handle
    legitimately needs to release its `logRefs` (`TransactionLog` JS-wrapper `napi_ref`s), and
    unlike a transaction there is no separate object to move that work onto. It instead keeps the
    same recycled-thread-id-guarded shape the transaction case used to have, and stays safe only
    because `DBRegistry::ReleaseLogRefsByEnv` → `DBDescriptor::releaseLogRefsByEnv` →
    `DBHandle::releaseLogRefs()`, wired into the same cleanup hook as `CloseTransactionsByEnv`,
    empties `logRefs` for every attached handle owned by the dying env **before** that env's
    thread id can be reused: the only way `close()`'s `ownerThreadId` check can misfire is after
    the real owner env is already gone, and by then this has already run, so the misfiring branch
    finds nothing left to release. Do not delete this hook call assuming `close()`'s guard is
    sufficient on its own — it is not, without the hook running first.

    The guard has a second consequence: a foreign close leaves `logRefs` populated, so
    `DBHandle::open()` releases it at the top of a reopen. Without that, `useLog()` returns the
    cached `TransactionLog` of the closed lifecycle, whose `TransactionLogHandle::store`
    `weak_ptr` is expired — only `addEntry` re-resolves, so every read accessor reports an empty
    log instead of the reopened one (`test/fixtures/fork-foreign-close-log-cache.mts`).

19. **A secondary open's identity is `{path, readOnly, secondaryPath}` and its workspace is
    exclusive**: `secondaryPath` opens via `DB::OpenAsSecondary` (a read-only follower of a live
    primary, advanced by `catchUpWithPrimary()`), and the registry `DBKey` carries all three fields
    — every purge/close path must reconstruct the FULL key via `descriptorKey()` (db_registry.h);
    a hand-built partial key silently misses the secondary's entry and leaks the descriptor plus
    the open RocksDB (the backup/backup-stream/checkpoint purge-retry destructors are the
    historical trap). A secondary forces `max_open_files = -1` because the eagerly-opened,
    fd-held table AND blob files are what make the primary's deletions safe — a bounded table
    cache reintroduces the exact missing-file race the mode exists to avoid (the same reason a
    plain `readOnly` open loses that race: it opens files it holds no reference on, and even a
    successful open reads lazily afterward). RocksDB does NOT stop two secondary instances from
    sharing one workspace and they corrupt each other's state
    (`test/native/secondary_blob_test.cc` proves the second open succeeds), so exclusivity is
    enforced by us: in-process by the registry key + a cross-primary scan in `OpenDB`,
    cross-process by a kernel advisory lock on `<secondaryPath>/.secondary.lock` (invariant 7's
    lock utility; released in `finishClose()` after `db.reset()`). Upstream documents
    secondary+BlobDB as unsupported (facebook/rocksdb#13296) while this codebase enables blob
    files unconditionally — the pinned build fd-holds blob files like SSTs (verified empirically),
    so `secondary_blob_test.cc` is the regression net that must stay green on every RocksDB
    upgrade. The missing-file open race classifier (`core/open_status.cpp`,
    `ERR_CONCURRENT_COMPACTION`) matches `.sst`, `.blob`, AND `.log` at a filename-token boundary —
    a live writer reclaims all three (compaction inputs, blob GC, flushed WAL segments) and each
    was observed as the file the read-only open tripped on. (A secondary open rarely needs it: its
    point-in-time replay falls back to the last fully-present version instead of failing.)

    Two adjacent rules the mode forced into existence. **A read-only or secondary open must not
    mutate the primary's transaction logs**: `DiscoverStores(path, callerReadOnly)` loads stores
    with no retention purge and no `recoverTail` truncation — the log directory may
    belong to a live writer in another process whose append-owned `size` would keep appending past
    a reader's truncation (invariant 5, the harper#2016 class); readers tolerate the unrecovered
    torn tail via the CorruptFrameError/resync protocol. **The OPENING handle's mode decides, not
    the registry entry's**: the entry is path-global, shared by every handle on the path, and
    outlives the handle that created it, so a writer that has since closed must not leave the entry
    stamped writable and make the next secondary's discovery load a newly-appeared store with
    recovery (the same rule `ResolveStore`'s `callerReadOnly` follows; the entry no longer carries a
    mode at all). The inverse hazard is a WRITER adopting
    stores a read-only open loaded without recovery (appends would land past a torn tail), so
    `EnsureWritableRegistrationSafe` — called at the top of `DBDescriptor::open`, NOT from
    `Register` (a throw there would run the half-built descriptor's close and decrement a refcount
    it never incremented) — rejects the writable open while read-only-loaded stores are live,
    deciding on each live store's own `TransactionLogStore::readOnly` for the same reason.
    A cross-process log reader also inherits a mapping hazard the same-process case does not
    have: a read-only file's `MAP_SHARED` overlay covers `[0, size)` including an unrecovered
    torn tail, so if the primary process restarts and its `recoverTail()` truncates below a
    mapped page, a follower scanning that region takes SIGBUS — an uncatchable process kill.
    Invariant 14's "POSIX needs none" reasoning covers a same-process writer only. Reading a
    read-only store through positional reads instead of a shared mapping is the fix; until then
    a follower against a crash-restarting primary carries that risk.
    A secondary's log view is therefore "what this process has resident", not a frozen extent: a
    store an in-process writer holds open — or creates later — is the same object, so its appends
    are visible; only a cross-process primary's new stores and appends need a reopen. That is
    not a leak of unsafe state — the log write completes before the RocksDB commit for every
    writer, so the log leads the database view by construction and every log consumer already has
    to tolerate it.
    Transaction-log paths follow the database identity rule too: the first opener captures the physical
    `transactionLogsPath` once at open and uses that immutable identity for discovery, appends,
    purge, and backup. It keeps that opener's original spelling separately for stats and returned purge
    paths. Re-resolving a symlinked or relative path after open can redirect the log half of a
    transaction to a different directory; returning only the resolved identity breaks callers
    that match paths against the spelling they supplied.
    And **`DBRegistry::DestroyDB` must claim and close EVERY descriptor for the path** (read-write,
    read-only, each secondary): erasing an entry unclosed leaks its resources for the life of the
    process — for a secondary, the workspace `.secondary.lock` is only released by `finishClose()`,
    so a leaked one wedges its workspace permanently. While any key for that physical path is
    closing, `OpenDB` must wait before opening every other key too; otherwise a fresh read-only or
    secondary key can appear after destroy's claim and be deleted and erased without being closed.

20. **A transaction timestamp freezes when native state captures it**: `setTimestamp()` may adopt an
    origin timestamp for replication or replay only while the transaction is pending and before any
    database write or transaction-log entry is staged. The log batch snapshots the timestamp at the
    first `addLogEntry`; `committedPosition` survives coordinated-retry resets, so a batch already
    written remains frozen across retries, though reapplying the same timestamp is idempotent while
    the transaction remains pending. rocksdb-js does not define record value layouts: a producer
    that copies `getTimestamp()` into record bytes must call `setTimestamp()` first.
21. **Transactional ranges keep the caller's column family and close before the transaction**:
    `Store.getRange()` routes `options.transaction` to native by transaction ID, where the caller
    database descriptor resolves it and supplies the caller's `DBHandle` to `DBIteratorHandle`.
    Replacing the context with `transaction._context` is incorrect for cross-column-family scans:
    that native transaction carries the column family on which it was created. Transaction ids are
    allocated per `DBDescriptor` (`nextTransactionId`), so an id from another database resolves in
    the caller's descriptor to an unrelated transaction of the same number; `Store.getTxnId()`
    rejects that by comparing `NativeDatabase.identityPath`, the resolved identity the registry
    keyed the descriptor on (`resolveIdentityPath`), cached on the `Store` at open. Never compare
    the path a caller passed to `open()`: it is a spelling, so `data` and `./data` — one database
    and one id space — would be rejected, while one relative path can name two databases across a
    `chdir`. Column families of a database share the identity, so cross-column-family reads pass.
    Transaction-backed iterators establish and pass the transaction snapshot, seek explicitly, and
    enforce their encoded
    bounds in `valid()` rather than trusting RocksDB alone: `iterate_lower_bound` is inclusive, so the
    exclusive lower bound of a reverse range (`exclusiveStart`) has to be applied by the handle when
    the iterator reaches it, and a transaction's write batch ignored the read-option bounds before
    RocksDB 8.10.0, so a build linked against an older release (`ROCKSDB_VERSION` / `ROCKSDB_PATH`)
    checks both bounds on transaction iterators (a compile-time `ROCKSDB_MAJOR`/`ROCKSDB_MINOR`
    check); the pinned 11.8.1 only pays the reverse `exclusiveStart` compare, like a plain iterator.
    `closeIterators()` waits for a handle that is mid-destruction on another thread to reset its
    RocksDB iterator before the transaction is freed; it does not serialize a cross-environment
    close against a `next()` in flight on the owning thread (the descriptor's closables sweep never
    did either). They register weakly with `TransactionHandle`; commit,
    abort, the coordinated-retry reset (`resetTransaction`), and forced teardown close every
    registered iterator before committing, rolling back, resetting, or deleting the RocksDB
    transaction, so a later `next()` deterministically reports an uninitialized iterator rather than
    reading freed write-batch state (`return()`/`throw()` stay idempotent so loop cleanup after that
    close cannot throw), and `createIterator` rejects a range or count once the transaction is no
    longer pending. The reverse seek always steps off a key equal to the encoded end
    bound: `inclusiveEnd` appends a NUL to that bound, so the bound itself is exclusive in both
    directions and a staged key that lands exactly on it must be excluded like a committed one.

22. **A WriteBufferManager stall is a second, entirely separate stall mechanism, and nothing in
    RocksDB reports it**: `DBImpl::WriteBufferManagerStallWrites` parks writers on the manager's own
    queue (`WBMStallInterface::Block`) without touching the `WriteController`, so `rocksdb.stall.micros`,
    the `WRITE_STALL` histogram, `OnStallConditionsChanged` — and therefore the `'writeStall'` event
    and `isWriteStalled()` (invariant 16's neighbours) — all stay at zero for its entire duration.
    Eight hours of wedged production read `0` on every one of them (HarperFast/rocksdb-js#822).
    `WriteBufferManager::IsStallActive()` against `memory_usage()`/`buffer_size()` is the only
    distinguishing signal, surfaced as `writeBufferManager.*` in `db.getStats()`/`getStat()` and
    `getWriteBufferManagerStats()`.

    **The watchdog owns a thread because every other tick in this process is blocked by the
    condition it reports.** `CommitWorker` parks in `db->Write()` (it is one of the wedged threads in
    #822's backtrace); `logWorker` is event-driven off commits the stall prevents;
    `ParkTimeoutRegistry`'s thread is per-descriptor and only exists after a VT conflict; RocksDB's
    stall callbacks never fire; and a JS timer cannot run on a thread parked in `store.putSync()`.
    So `DBStats` owns one process-wide thread, created lazily the first time a manager exists **with**
    `allowStall` (`ShouldStall()` short-circuits otherwise, so no stall is reachable). Runtime disable
    parks that thread and re-enable arms it with a fresh episode state; explicit shutdown and final
    teardown join it. Since `shutdown()` supports reopening databases, every `ensure` advances an
    arm-request generation that `shutdown()` snapshots before closing databases. A rearm-capable
    joiner returns without retiring when that generation changed, so an older shutdown cannot stop a
    watchdog belonging to a concurrent reopen. Once a joiner takes a thread, the stop latch resets
    only after that thread has joined; callers that find no thread return without mutating the stop
    state. Two envs calling `shutdown()` at once both reach the join, and letting a non-owner clear
    the latch stranded the owner inside `join()` forever: the thread had not observed the stop yet,
    so it went back to waiting on `stopRequested || armed` with both false. `watchdogRetiring` makes
    the non-owning joiners wait for the retirement instead
    (`test/fixtures/fork-wbm-watchdog-shutdown.mts`, which reproduces the hang about one run in three
    without the fix). It samples one relaxed atomic per second. Plain `std::thread`,
    not `uv_timer_t`, for invariant 12's reason.

    Three constraints on that thread, each of which has a failure mode:
    - **Lock order is `databasesMutex -> writeBufferManagerMutex -> watchdogMutex`**, because
      `DBRegistry::OpenDB` holds `databasesMutex` across `DBDescriptor::open`, which calls
      `getWriteBufferManager()`. The watchdog drops `watchdogMutex` before every sample and only
      try-locks the registry and column inventories, so there is no cycle. `ensure` and `disable`
      only arm or park it because they run under higher-order locks and its stderr write may block;
      joining is `DBStats::joinWriteBufferManagerWatchdog()`'s final-teardown job alone. `DBStats::Init()`
      materializes the watchdog owner after `DBRegistry`, while its constructor first materializes
      `DBSettings` and `GlobalEvents`; reverse static destruction therefore joins the watchdog before
      any dependency it reads is destroyed.
    - **Stop and join both follow the flush** (`binding.cpp`, both the `shutdown()` export and the
      last-env cleanup hook): snapshot the arm-request generation, run `DBRegistry::Shutdown()`, then
      stop and join. Keeping the watchdog live through the flush lets it write to `stderr` when
      shutdown itself is wedged behind a stalled writer; global listeners have already been released.
      Joining after the flush also keeps a blocking stderr write out of the durability path.
    - **The inventory counts only column families that can explain the budget** — descriptors that
      attached _this_ manager (attachment is decided per open, so a database opened before the
      manager was configured, or while its size was 0, has not). Read-only opens are included because
      WAL recovery can retain charged memtables. A dropped family can remain charged through a live
      handle after leaving the by-name map, so `unregisterColumnFamily` moves it to
      `DBDescriptor::droppedColumns` — a `weak_ptr` plus a copy of its retention target — and the
      walk keeps counting it until that last handle closes. Only `expired()` is ever called on that
      reference: `lock()`ing it would make the sampling thread the potential last releaser, running
      `~ColumnFamilyDescriptor` (and the RocksDB handle it owns) under both inventory locks. Latching
      the descriptor unavailable instead was the first attempt, and one `dropSync()` then blinded the
      report for the life of the database. The retention value it reports is the **effective**
      `max_write_buffer_size_to_maintain` read from `db->GetOptions(cf)` at creation, never the
      requested one: #821's whole finding is that `TransactionDB::Open` rewrites a requested `0` into
      256 MiB per CF, so the requested value hides the fact the report exists to expose.

    The report is one line per _episode_ (a stall must be continuously active past the threshold),
    with deliberately no second rate-limit window on top — a window would suppress the first line of
    a genuinely new episode, which is the one that matters. The decision FSM is Node-free in
    `core/wbm_stall_watchdog.h` and GoogleTest-covered; a test that reaches a real stall must run in
     a child process the parent kills on a deadline, because the stalled writer blocks the JS thread
     and the runner's own timeout cannot fire (#781 item 2).

 19. **A transaction timestamp is only unique within one process unless the caller names its log**:
    `getMonotonicTimestamp()` (`core/platform.cpp`) ratchets a file-static atomic that starts at `0`
    in every new process, then re-reads the wall clock — so a backward clock step between runs
    reissues transaction timestamps, which are transaction-log batch keys (`writeBatch`) and, for a
    producer that encodes them, record versions. The `timestampFloorLog` open option names the log
    this process _originates_; `TransactionLogStoreRegistry::SeedTimestampFloor` walks that store
    after `DiscoverStores()` and raises the floor, inside `DBDescriptor::open` and therefore before
    any handle — and so any transaction — exists.
    **The log must be named, never inferred.** `useLog(name)` takes an arbitrary name and native
    code has no origin semantics for it: Harper opens one log per origin node and a replication
    receiver adopts the origin's timestamp through `setTimestamp()` before writing, so a peer's log
    is keyed by _that node's_ clock. Seeding from every log would ratchet this node's clock to the
    fastest peer at each restart, and the peers would adopt those keys onward. Two other traps the
    implementation encodes: the seed runs **after** recovery, because a key in bytes `recoverTail()`
    truncates is not durable; and **every segment is walked**, because keys are unordered and a
    segment header holds only `latestTimestamp` as of that segment's creation — which, starting at
    `0` each process, is _below_ older segments' keys after a rollback, not above them. Failure is
     best effort by design (a `log.warn`, not a refused open): one unreadable legacy segment must not
     make a database unopenable.

23. **A queued unlock callback belongs to its env and is released by that env's cleanup hook**:
    `tryLock(key, callback)` on a held key queues the callback as a threadsafe function of the
    caller's env on the shared `LockHandle` (`DBDescriptor::lockEnqueueCallback`), and only the
    holder's `unlock()` (`lockReleaseByKey`) or `db.close()` (`lockReleaseByOwner`) ever calls it. A
    `worker_threads` env that is `terminate()`d never closes its handles in order, so its callback
    stayed queued on a lock another env held; that env's later `unlock()` then called a tsfn Node had
    already freed — Node 24 returns `napi_closing`, Node 22 aborts the process (rocksdb-js#848;
    harper's derived-index runner kept exactly such a waiter on every non-owner worker, and Harper's
    thread manager terminates workers on restart). Every `LockCallback` now records its `napi_env`,
    and `DBRegistry::ReleaseLockCallbacksByEnv` → `DBDescriptor::releaseLockCallbacksByEnv`, wired
    into the module env-cleanup hook beside `ReleaseParkTimeoutsByEnv`, releases (never calls) the
    dying env's callbacks. The release paths hold `locksMutex` **across** their tsfn calls for the
    same reason `EventEmitter::notify` holds its mutex (harper#1370): the cleanup hook takes that
    mutex too, so it either removes a callback before the call or waits until the call has returned,
    and Node cannot free the tsfn under `napi_call_threadsafe_function`. Calling a tsfn only enqueues
    onto its env's loop, so holding the mutex across it cannot re-enter. `test/lock-teardown-abort.test.ts`
    is the child-process repro; it also proves a live waiter is still woken.
24. **A column family is dropped logically at once and physically only when no admitted commit
    names it**: `Database::Drop`/`DropSync` used to call `DropColumnFamily` immediately, and a
    transaction commit already inside RocksDB naming that family — past optimistic validation
    under the default `kValidateParallel`, or any pessimistic commit — failed in the memtable
    inserter with `Invalid column family specified in write batch`, which `HandleMemTableInsertFailure`
    latches as a fatal background error on the whole database (#806, #726; harper#1381). The rule
    now (`core/column_family_lifetime.h`, GoogleTest-covered): a commit **claims** every family
    its batch names once, at admission in `executeLogWork`/`CommitSync` **before** the
    transaction-log write (`ColumnFamilyCommitClaim`, RAII so a log-write failure, N-API/queue
    failure, cancellation or teardown releases it), and releases right after `txn->Commit()`
    returns; a drop **retires** the generation under `columnsMutex` (`DBDescriptor::retireColumnFamily`:
    identity-checked erase from `columns`, `retired = true`, entry in `retiring`) and runs the
    physical drop itself only when `admitted == 0`, otherwise the last releasing commit runs it
    (`reclaimColumnFamily`). In the deferred case that last release runs `DropColumnFamily` inline:
    an async commit lane pays the MANIFEST write/fsync before dispatching its completion and commits
    queued behind it wait too, while `commitSync()` pays it on its calling JS thread. Moving
    reclamation elsewhere would need a new lifetime owner. An admitted commit's transaction-log
    entries are published even though the subsequent physical drop discards its data; downstream
    consumers must order the schema drop after those entries.
    Both sides are seq_cst two-phase (`retired` store then `admitted`
    load, versus `admitted` increment then `retired` load), so at least one side observes the other,
    and `claimReclaim()` makes exactly one of them run `DropColumnFamily` — after re-checking
    `admitted == 0` under the claim (a retirer can observe the transient claim of an admission about
    to be refused; it unclaims, re-reads, and either retries or leaves the drop to that admission's
    release, so the generation is never left to nobody). Staging only **records** the families a
    transaction touched (`TransactionHandle::touchedColumnFamilies`: **weak** references plus a raw
    pointer for comparison, inline for 2, most-recent slot compared first, the never-droppable
    default family skipped, cleared by `resetTransaction()` because the retry callback may touch a
    different set) and refuses every write to a retired family; it holds no claim. Weak, not strong:
    a transaction can outlive its database (an aborted handle JS still references after `close()`),
    and a strong reference there destroyed the RocksDB column-family handle after `finishClose()`
    had destroyed the database (SIGSEGV in `test/txn-close-commit-uaf.test.ts`). The commit locks
    them only for its claim, with the overflow storage reserved before the first claim is published
    so recording one cannot fail after its count was taken; a lock that fails is a
    dropped-and-reclaimed generation and refuses the commit like a retired one. That is deliberate:
    a staged-but-idle, abandoned, or drain-timeout-leaked (#784)
    transaction must not be able to block reclamation or a same-name recreate, and Harper calls
    `dropSync()` from a synchronous schema section with transactions staged on that same thread.

    **Only write batches need this.** Verified on the pinned build: after a physical drop, a
    retained handle still serves `get`, iteration and counts for every key (RocksDB's own handle
    refcount keeps the dropped `ColumnFamilyData` readable until the handle is destroyed), a
    non-transactional write is discarded by `ignore_missing_column_families` (#725), and a
    transaction staged after the drop fails at validation. The only hazard is a batch naming the
    id entering the write thread after `SetDropped()` removed the id from the column-family set.
    So handles, iterators, async reads and user shared buffers do not pin the generation — an
    "every owner pins" design (drop in `~ColumnFamilyDescriptor`) was rejected because RocksDB
    cannot hold two families of one name, so it blocks `open()` of the dropped name until every
    worker's JS handle closes or is collected, breaking immediate same-name recreate and making
    correctness depend on GC.

    A staging call reserves its touched-set entry before calling RocksDB so allocation can never
    leave an untracked write in the batch, but removes that new entry again when `Put`/`Delete`
    fails before accepting the mutation. **Both sides of a dropped-family refusal — staging and a
    terminal admission — mark the transaction's writes abandoned and release its VT intents**, so a
    caller retaining the transaction for reads cannot leave coordinated-retry writers parked, and
    one that catches the staging error cannot then commit the families it wrote before it. They must
    not diverge: which side catches a write naming a dropped family is decided by when the drop
    landed relative to that write, a race the caller cannot observe, so a per-operation refusal on
    one side and a whole-transaction refusal on the other would make the contract depend on timing.
    A failure from `putSync`/`removeSync` is fatal to the transaction when the generation is retired
    by the time RocksDB returns, even if the immediate failure (such as a pessimistic lock timeout)
    was not itself caused by the drop. This deliberately keeps the contract independent of an
    unobservable race. It abandons before anything on that path can throw so a failure still fails
    closed (the commit is refused as `ERR_WRITES_ABANDONED` instead). `writesAbandoned`
    gates writes and commits only, never reads: an abandoned transaction keeps serving its own
    staged writes, so a caller that catches either refusal rather than letting it propagate must not
    read a value back through that transaction and carry it forward. That is deliberate — reads stay
    valid so a caller can inspect state before aborting — but unlike `abandonWrites()` the state is
    now reachable as a side effect of a failed write, so it is the caller-visible half worth knowing. Every explicit log-stage claim release passes the live
    descriptor — including synchronous log-write failure — so the last release retries reclamation
    immediately rather than waiting for an unrelated drop/open/close.

    Caller-visible contract: the name is gone from `db.columns` and reopenable as a fresh family
    before `drop()` returns; a transaction that stages a write to a retired family, or commits one
    it staged before the retire, is refused whole with `ERR_COLUMN_FAMILY_DROPPED`
    (`Column family "x" was dropped`). "Refused whole" holds even for a caller that catches the
    staging error: the transaction's writes are abandoned at that point, so its later `commit()`
    throws `ERR_WRITES_ABANDONED` rather than applying the families it wrote first. On the first
    attempt that decision precedes every log byte;
    after an `IsBusy`/`TryAgain` retry, the original attempt's write-once log position survives, so a
    later refusal is correctly reported as `ERR_TRANSACTION_ABANDONED`. A commit admitted before
    the retire lands in the dying generation, linearized before the drop; reads through retained
    handles continue; non-transactional writes keep #725's silent discard. `DBRegistry::OpenDB`
    finds a `retiring` entry for the name under `columnsMutex` (so a drop cannot slip between the
    decision and the create), then simply asks `reclaimColumnFamily` to run the physical drop, under
    `databasesMutex` like the create itself — deadlock-free because a claim is only ever held by a
    commit inside RocksDB on a lane, a libuv thread, or another thread's `commitSync`, never parked
    on the opener's event loop. This deliberately serializes that rare retry's MANIFEST write/fsync
    with process-wide open/close/destroy; unlocking would require a strong descriptor pin whose
    transient ref can make a concurrent last-handle close skip its only registry purge. `attempted`
    is the whole decision: true and failed throws, true and
    OK creates the fresh family, false means a commit still holds the generation or another thread
    is already dropping it, so the open waits in 20 ms slices bounded by
    `ROCKSDB_JS_CF_RECLAIM_WAIT_MS` (default 30 s). **Do not reintroduce a status enum on the
    `retiring` entry.** An earlier revision tracked `Pending`/`Reclaiming`/`Failed` there, which
    duplicated `lifetime.admitted`/`reclaimClaimed` in a second place that had to be kept in step
    under a different lock; asking the one function that already reads those atomics is both shorter
    and impossible to desynchronize.

    Reclamation is retryable and never silently lost: membership in `retiring` IS "retry me", so a
    failed `DropColumnFamily` only has to release its reclaim claim and leave the entry in place
    (the whole path is `noexcept` because it runs from commit completions and destructors, and the
    claim is released before any diagnostic allocation). It reports through the global `log.warn`
    event and `columnFamily.pendingReclaims`,
    and is retried on the next drop on the database, the next `open()` of that name (retried inline
    with `columnsMutex` released; a second failure throws), and `finishClose()`, which then destroys
    the RocksDB handle of every generation still in `retiring` ahead of the database. Legacy libuv
    commits participate in the descriptor's `operationsInFlight` accounting, so close cannot reach
    this retry until their commit claims and transaction async-work registrations have been
    released; destroying any remaining handles before the database is still the final defense.
    `reclaimColumnFamily` also participates in that accounting and stands down once the descriptor
    is closing, skipping a generation whose handle is gone rather than dropping into a destroyed
    database. Retry is idempotent
    because RocksDB removes the family (`LogAndApply`, `SetDropped`) before it persists OPTIONS, so a
    drop that failed past the MANIFEST publish retries as "Column family already dropped", which is
    success. The retired name is never reinserted. A second handle to the same retired generation
    retries a failed drop on its own `drop()`; a stale handle to an older generation is a no-op that
    can never touch a recreated family (the identity check). `reclaimColumnFamily` is never called
    under `columnsMutex`, `txnsMutex` or the VT `writerMutex_`; every caller already holds a strong
    `DBDescriptor` (the commit lane's task capture, the JS handle, `finishClose` itself), so the
    column-family descriptor carries no back-reference and the ownership graph stays acyclic.

    **Not guaranteed across a restart**: a process that exits while a physical drop is pending
    (only while a commit admitted before the drop is still inside RocksDB) or after one failed leaves
    the family on disk under its name, and the next open lists it as live; a backup or checkpoint
    taken inside that window copies it. The immediate drop had the same exposure after a failure and
    none during the window, which did not exist. A durable tombstone belongs to the caller; an
    integration must retain or recover it until physical completion before claiming crash durability.
    This subsumes the
    commit-time admission gate of PR #843: that gate's drop waited for admitted commits and closed
    admission around `txn->Commit()` only; here the same admission is taken once, earlier, and the
    wait is replaced by deferral to the last releaser, so no immediate-drop path remains for the gate
    to protect.

25. **Two process-wide clocks, two contracts — never route one through the other**:
    `getMonotonicTimestamp()` (`core/platform.cpp`) is a wall-clock ratchet: Unix-epoch
    milliseconds made strictly increasing with `nextafter` on a tie or a backward host-clock step.
    It is the transaction timestamp and transaction-log batch key, so it must stay in the epoch
    domain and comparable across processes and restarts (docs/transaction-timestamp-integrity-design.md,
    #825). The price is that after a backward step it advances one ulp per call until the wall
    catches up, so a difference between two calls understates real elapsed time and a deadline
    computed from it stretches. `steadyClockNow()` (module-level export, `getSteadyClockNow()` in
    `core/platform.cpp`, docs/steady-clock-design.md) is `std::chrono::steady_clock` as fractional
    milliseconds from an unspecified per-process origin: one domain across every thread and env in the
    process (Bun gives each worker its own `performance.timeOrigin`/`hrtime` origin, which is why the
    native layer owns this), non-decreasing but **not unique**, unaffected by wall steps, and not
    meaningful across processes or restarts. Neither substitutes for the other: making the ratchet
    steady would break the durable epoch contract, and adding a ratchet to the steady clock would
    distort elapsed measurement under contention. Whether host suspend counts is platform-defined
    (Linux excludes it; current macOS and Windows implementations include it).
26. **No `rocksdb::DB` may outlive the module's env-cleanup hook**: `DBRegistry::instance` is a
    namespace-scope `static`, so anything still in `instance->databases` when the hook returns is
    destroyed from an `atexit` handler. Closing a RocksDB database there runs
    `DBImpl::CancelAllBackgroundWork()` → `PeriodicTaskScheduler::Unregister()` **after** RocksDB's
    own function-local statics have been destroyed, and RocksDB's `PthreadCall` wrapper reacts to
    the resulting `EINVAL` by printing `pthread lock: Invalid argument` and calling `std::abort()` —
    a process that ran every test successfully then dies with SIGABRT (or, on the injected-flush
    path, hangs forever in `WaitForFlushMemTables` with no background thread left to service it).
    `DBRegistry::Shutdown()` normally empties the map, but a descriptor whose close-time flush
    failed is deliberately **quarantined** (invariant 6) so `shutdown()`/`destroy()` can retry —
    and at process exit there is no later retry. `DBRegistry::Teardown()`, called from the hook
    right after `Shutdown()`, releases whatever is left while RocksDB is still usable. The general
    trap: anything the registry retains for a caller to retry needs a defined terminal owner,
    because "the static destructor" is not one. Covered by
    `test/fixtures/fork-quarantined-exit.mts`; the same shape reproduces from JS by leaving a
    database with a sticky RocksDB background error (`test/background-error.test.ts` used to,
    which is why its fixtures now tear down with `destroy()` rather than `close()`).

27. **A reopened handle clears its cancellation only after `DBRegistry::OpenDB()` finishes its
    lifecycle waits**:
    `DBHandle::close()` publishes `cancelled` (and, per invariant 6, the per-handle compaction
    token), and every async admission refuses while either stands — so `DBHandle::open()` has to
    clear them for a documented close/reopen cycle to work. `OpenDB()` blocks while a foreign
    `destroy()`/`shutdown()` owns the old path, and that teardown's closables sweep force-closes
    this still-attached handle mid-wait, re-arming both flags. Clearing before those waits therefore
    leaves the re-arm standing over the _newly_ opened descriptor. The reset now runs after every
    wait and while `databasesMutex` still excludes a new closer, immediately before the handle is
    attached to the selected descriptor. Because the reset takes the handle's async-work
    `waitMutex` and attachment takes the descriptor's `txnsMutex`, the established order is
    `databasesMutex` → `waitMutex` → `txnsMutex`; code holding `waitMutex` must release it before
    calling back into the registry. Async-state destructors that retry `PurgeIfUnreferenced()`
    release their descriptor before the base destructor unregisters async work, preserving that
    order.

28. **Handle adoption and descriptor attachment are one registry-locked publication**:
    `DBRegistry::OpenDB()` selects the descriptor and column family, clears stale close cancellation,
    publishes every descriptor-backed handle field, and inserts the handle into
    `DBDescriptor::closables` before releasing `databasesMutex`. The owner-thread-only `path` is set
    before registry work so that a failed open can still follow a quarantine error's `destroy()`
    recovery, but teardown never reads that field from `closables`. A forced
    `destroy()`/`shutdown()` claims under the same mutex,
    so it either precedes the open or sees the fully adopted handle in the closables sweep. Returning
    `DBHandleParams` and attaching in `Database::Open()` left a gap where teardown could reset
    `descriptor->db` while the invisible handle retained a `ColumnFamilyHandle`; destroying that
    column handle after its DB is a native use-after-free. No handle shared-pointer field may be read
    after the registry lock drops, because a foreign sweep may immediately reset it. Covered by
    `test/fixtures/fork-open-attach-destroy.mts`; `ROCKSDB_JS_OPEN_ATTACH_DELAY_MS` widens the point
    after atomic publication so the fixture can assert the exact closables count before destroy.

29. **A user shared buffer lives as long as its column family is open, never as long as some view
    of it**: `getUserSharedBuffer` used to erase the map entry once the last external `ArrayBuffer`
    for a key was collected, and the next call re-seeded the key from the caller's default. Every
    consumer keys boot-lifetime process state on it — id counters, a branch's claim word, blob hold
    counts, replication status — and the only holders of a view are the workers that happen to have
    resolved it, so a worker exiting or a GC after the last local view dropped silently reset state
    the other workers were still relying on (harper#2690 and harper-pro#431 each grew a retention
    layer to defeat it). The map keeps its entry until the column family is torn down; the
    finalizer only removes the listener registered with that view. The corollary is the
    documented contract: key buffers on a small fixed set of names, because nothing evicts them.

## Debugging native heap corruption

AddressSanitizer is the first choice (`ROCKSDB_ASAN=1 node-gyp rebuild` toggles `-fsanitize=address`
on the binding via `binding.gyp`). On Linux, `LD_PRELOAD` the libasan shared object to run the
instrumented `.node` under stock node; `.github/workflows/benchmark-asan.yml` does this and loops the
worker benchmarks. **ASan does not work locally on recent macOS** — the runtime deadlocks at init even
for a trivial binary, and Node additionally hangs under a DYLD-injected ASan runtime. Use Apple's
**Guard Malloc** there instead (no rebuild needed): `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=/usr/lib/libgmalloc.dylib
MallocScribble=1 node ...` faults immediately on an out-of-bounds access or use-after-free (it works
with `worker_threads`). To reproduce a teardown/lifecycle race, drive the relevant workers in a tight
loop under Guard Malloc and capture the stack with `lldb -b -o 'break set -n __cxa_throw' -o run -o bt`.
