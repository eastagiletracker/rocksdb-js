# rocksdb-js

A Node.js binding for the RocksDB library.

## Features

- Supports optimistic and pessimistic transactions
- Hybrid sync/async data retrieval
- Range queries return an iterable with array-like methods and lazy evaluation
- Transaction log system for recording transaction related data
- Custom stores provide ability to override default database interactions
- Efficient binary key and value encoding
- Configurable block/blob compression (LZ4, Zstd, Zlib, and more)
- Observable background errors via the `'error'` event or `db.getLastError()`, with in-process
  recovery (`db.resume()`)
- Access to internal RocksDB statistics
- Designed for Node.js and Bun on Linux, macOS, and Windows

## Example

```typescript
const db = RocksDatabase.open('/path/to/db');

for (const key of ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']) {
	await db.put(key, `value ${key}`);
}

console.log(await db.get('b')); // `value b`

for (const { key, value } of db.getRange({ start: 'b', end: 'd' })) {
	console.log(`${key} = ${value}`);
}

await db.transaction(async (txn: Transaction) => {
	await txn.put('f', 'value f');
	await txn.remove('c');
});
```

## Usage

### `new RocksDatabase(path, options?)`

Creates a new database instance.

- `path: string` The path to write the database files to. This path does not need to exist, but the
  parent directories do.
- `options: object` [optional]
  - `compression: string | { algorithm: string, level?: number }` The block/blob compression
    algorithm for this column family. Pass an algorithm name — one of `'none'`, `'snappy'`,
    `'zlib'`, `'bzip2'`, `'lz4'`, `'lz4hc'`, or `'zstd'` — or an object with an
    `algorithm` and an optional `level` (forwarded to RocksDB's `compression_opts.level`; the
    meaning is algorithm-specific). Applies to both SST data blocks and blob files (large values).
    Defaults to `'lz4'` when the native build supports it, otherwise RocksDB's own default (Snappy
    when linked, else no compression). See [Compression](#compression). Throws if the algorithm is
    not compiled into the native build — check [`supportedCompression`](#supportedcompression) for
    the available list.
  - `compressionForAllColumnFamilies: boolean` When `true`, applies `compression` to every column
    family opened for the database rather than only the column family specified by `name`. Requires an explicit
    `compression`. Defaults to `false`. See [Compression](#compression).
  - `dbWriteBufferSize: number` The total memtable memory budget in bytes shared across all of the
    database's column families. When the combined size of all memtables reaches this value, RocksDB
    flushes the largest one. `0` (the default) disables this global trigger, so per-column-family
    `writeBufferSize` alone drives flushing. This is distinct from the process-wide
    [`writeBufferManagerSize`](#dbconfigoptions) config option. Database-wide, so it binds when the
    path is first opened in this process: a later open of the same path — including from another
    worker thread — keeps the first opener's value rather than overriding or rejecting it.
  - `disableWAL: boolean` Whether to disable the RocksDB write ahead log. Defaults to `false`.
  - `enableStats: boolean` When `true` and the database is open, RocksDB will captures stats that
    are retrieved by calling `db.getStats()`. Enabling statistics imposes 5-10% in overhead.
    Defaults to `false`.
  - `infoLogLevel: number` The verbosity of RocksDB's informational logging (`LOG` /
    `LOG.old.*`): `0` (debug), `1` (info), `2` (warn), `3` (error), `4` (fatal), or `5`
    (header-only). Omit to leave RocksDB's own default (`INFO_LEVEL` in a release build of the
    linked RocksDB library). See [`db.logOptions`](#dblogoptions-maxlogfilesize-number-infologlevel-number).
  - `maxLogFileSize: number` The per-file size cap, in bytes, for informational log files (`LOG` /
    `LOG.old.*`). RocksDB retains up to 5 of these files, so the total informational-log footprint
    is bounded at roughly `5 * maxLogFileSize`. Defaults to 16 MB (an 80 MB bound), which stops
    purely informational logging from growing without bound. A value of `0` is RocksDB's special
    "single unbounded log file" mode — it **disables size-based rotation entirely**, so the log
    can grow without limit; only set `0` if you deliberately want that (it forgoes the bounded
    footprint this option otherwise provides). See
    [`db.logOptions`](#dblogoptions-maxlogfilesize-number-infologlevel-number).
  - `maxOpenFiles: number` The maximum number of table files RocksDB keeps open. `0` (the default)
    derives a budget from the effective per-process open-file limit (an eighth of the limit —
    several databases can share one process — clamped to `[1024, 262144]`); `-1` holds every table
    file open (the RocksDB default, which can exhaust the process file-descriptor limit when
    compaction falls behind under sustained ingest); a positive `int32` is an explicit cap. Reads
    only pay a reopen cost when the number of live table files exceeds the budget, so raise the
    process fd limit (and with it the derived budget) for very large databases.
  - `maxWriteBufferNumber: number` The maximum number of memtables that can be queued per column
    family before writes stall. Higher values absorb write bursts while flushes catch up, at the
    cost of memory (roughly `maxWriteBufferNumber * writeBufferSize` per column family). Defaults to
    `16`.
  - `maxWriteBufferSizeToMaintain: number` The number of bytes of recent memtable history to keep in
    memory for transaction conflict checking. `-1` (the default) derives the value from
    `maxWriteBufferNumber * writeBufferSize` (the RocksDB-recommended default for optimistic
    transactions) — except when the database has a [`writeBufferManager`](#dbconfigoptions)
    attached, in which case it resolves to `1` so the manager is not filled with history it will
    never release. What decides this is the manager the database itself holds, not the current
    `writeBufferManagerSize`: a column family created later on an already-open database is clamped
    too, because its history is still charged to that manager. It also applies to any attached
    manager, not only a stalling one — `writeBufferManagerAllowStall` can be changed at runtime
    while this value is fixed when a column family is created, and history the budget cannot reclaim
    is a problem either way. `1` is the smallest target a transactional database can be given: RocksDB's transaction wrappers rewrite a `0` target to
    the derived value, so `0` requests the _largest_ history rather than none, and an explicitly
    requested `0` is normalized to `1` for the same reason. A positive target still retains the most
    recent flushed memtable per column family until that family's next write. An explicit positive
    value is honored as-is; sizing it against the budget and the column-family count is then yours,
    and a configuration whose known families already reach the budget is reported on the
    [`'log.warn'`](#event-api) channel.
  - `name: string` The column family name. Defaults to `"default"`.
  - `noBlockCache: boolean` When `true`, disables the block cache. Block caching is enabled by
    default and the cache is shared across all database instances.
  - `parallelismThreads: number` The number of background threads to use for flush and compaction.
    Defaults to `1`.
  - `pessimistic: boolean` When `true`, throws conflict errors when they occur instead of waiting
    until commit. Defaults to `false`.
  - `readOnly: boolean` When `true`, the database is opened in read-only mode. Read operations are
    permitted. Write operations will throw an error with code `ERR_DATABASE_READONLY`. Transactions
    are a no-op in read-only mode. [`flush()`](#dbflushoptions-promisevoid),
    [`flushSync()`](#dbflushsyncoptions-void), [`compact()`](#dbcompactoptions-promisevoid) and
    [`compactSync()`](#dbcompactsyncoptions-void) are the exception: they have nothing to do when
    there are no writes, so they succeed as no-ops rather than throwing.

    A read-only open is a **point-in-time snapshot**: it never sees later writes. It is safe
    against a quiescent database, but **unsafe against a live writer**: the open holds no reference
    on the files it is about to read, so a concurrent compaction, blob GC, or flush in the writing
    process can delete one mid-open and the open throws with code `ERR_CONCURRENT_COMPACTION` — the
    database is not corrupt; the reader lost a race, and retrying can succeed. Even a successful
    open can fail _later reads_ the same way, because files the snapshot references are opened
    lazily while the writer keeps deleting obsolete ones. To follow a database another process is
    actively writing, open a secondary instead (`secondaryPath` below) — that is the supported mode
    for a live follower.

  - `secondaryPath: string` Opens the database as a **secondary instance**: a read-only follower of
    a live primary that tolerates the primary deleting files and sees new writes on each
    [`catchUpWithPrimary()`](#dbcatchupwithprimary-promisevoid) call. This is the supported way to
    read a database another process is actively writing. The value is the secondary instance's own
    workspace directory (created if missing) where RocksDB keeps the secondary's private state — it
    must be outside `path` (enforced) and exclusive to one secondary instance. Exclusivity is
    enforced: reusing a workspace in-process for a different database is rejected at open (the same
    database + workspace share the one follower instance), and a kernel advisory lock on
    `<secondaryPath>/.secondary.lock` (same discipline and caveats as the
    [backup directory lock](#backups)) excludes other processes — with the same limits: on
    filesystems without advisory locking (`flock` unsupported — e.g. the FUSE/9p mounts behind
    Docker Desktop bind mounts) the lock degrades to a no-op, and on network filesystems with
    node-local `flock` (NFS `local_lock`, CIFS, 9p) it does not exclude across hosts, so workspace
    exclusivity is the caller's job there. Implies
    `readOnly: true` (an explicit `readOnly: false` throws), so all read-only behavior above
    applies. Forces `maxOpenFiles: -1`: every table and blob file is opened and held for the life
    of each version, which is what makes the primary's deletions safe — budget file descriptors
    accordingly on large databases (an explicit `maxOpenFiles` other than `-1` is rejected). Column
    families created by the primary after the secondary opens are invisible until the secondary
    reopens. Note: RocksDB upstream documents secondary instances as unsupported in combination
    with integrated BlobDB (which this library enables for values ≥ 2KB); the pinned RocksDB build
    handles blob files in secondary mode — covered by native regression tests — but upstream does
    not guarantee the combination.
  - `statsLevel: StatsLevel` Controls which type of statistics to skip and reduce statistic
    overhead. Defaults to `StatsLevel.ExceptDetailedTimers`.
  - `store: Store` A custom store that handles all interaction between the `RocksDatabase` or
    `Transaction` instances and the native database interface. A store is bound to a single
    `RocksDatabase` instance and cannot be shared between them. See [Custom Store](#custom-store) for
    more information.
  - `transactionLogMaxAgeThreshold: number` The threshold for the transaction log file's last
    modified time to be older than the retention period before it is rotated to the next sequence
    number. Value must be between `0.0` and `1.0`. A threshold of `0.0` means ignore age check.
    Defaults to `0.75`.
  - `transactionLogMaxSize: number` The target maximum size of a transaction log file. Transactions
    are never split across files: if the complete transaction does not fit, the log rotates before
    writing it. A transaction written to an empty file may exceed the target. Defaults to 16 MB.
  - `transactionLogRetention: string | number` The number of minutes to retain transaction logs
    before purging. Defaults to `'3d'` (3 days).
  - `transactionLogsPath: string` The path to store transaction logs. Defaults to
    `"${db.path}/transaction_logs"`.
  - `timestampFloorLog: string` The name of the transaction log whose batch keys this process
    originates. At open, the process-wide monotonic clock is raised above every batch key still
    durable in that log, so a backward wall-clock step between runs cannot reissue a transaction
    timestamp that is already a key in it. See
    [Timestamp floor at open](#timestamp-floor-at-open). Unset by default, which leaves the clock
    alone.
  - `verificationTable: boolean` When `true`, this column family participates in the process-global
    [Verification Table](#verification-table): transaction writes to this column family invalidate
    the verification slot for each written key. Enable this only for column families whose records
    are cached (e.g. the primary column family of a table). Defaults to `false`. Requires
    `verificationTableEntries` to be configured before the first database is opened.
  - `writeBufferSize: number` The per-column-family memtable size in bytes at which the memtable is
    sealed and flushed to an SST file. Smaller values produce more frequent, faster flushes; larger
    values batch more writes per SST file at the cost of memory. Defaults to `16777216` (16 MB).

### `db.close()`

Closes a database. This function can be called multiple times and will only close an opened
database. A database instance can be reopened once it is closed. A flush failure leaves the native
database quarantined so `shutdown()` can retry without losing unflushed data; an explicit
`destroy()` can instead delete it. A failure while waiting for compaction to settle is reported
after native teardown completes; the optional `compactOnClose` pass itself is best-effort and its
errors do not fail the close, since a skipped compaction loses no data. All native close errors
emit `database:closeFailed`. The quarantine applies to both writable and read-only opens because
both modes share the physical path lifecycle.

```typescript
const db = RocksDatabase.open('foo');
db.close();
```

### `db.columns: string[]`

Returns the list of column families in the RocksDB database.

```typescript
const db = RocksDatabase.open('path/to/db');
console.log(db.columns); // ['default']

db.use('users');
console.log(db.columns); // ['default', 'users']
```

### `db.compression: { algorithm: string, level?: number }`

Returns the compression currently in effect for this database's column family, read live from
RocksDB. `algorithm` is a friendly name (e.g. `'lz4'`, `'zstd'`, `'none'`); `level` is present only
when a non-default compression level is set. The database must be open. See
[Compression](#compression).

```typescript
const db = RocksDatabase.open('path/to/db', {
	compression: { algorithm: 'zstd', level: 3 },
});
console.log(db.compression); // { algorithm: 'zstd', level: 3 }
```

### `db.config(options)`

Sets global database settings.

- `options: object`
  - `blockCacheSize: number` The amount of memory in bytes to use to cache uncompressed blocks.
    Defaults to 32MB. Set to `0` (zero) disables block cache for future opened databases. Existing
    block cache for any opened databases is resized immediately. Negative values throw an error.
  - `compactOnClose: boolean` When `true`, compacts the database on close. Defaults to `false`.
  - `lifecycleWaitSeconds: number` How long a synchronous open, destroy, or shutdown waits for a
    _conflicting_ lifecycle operation already in progress on the same path (e.g. another open or
    close) before throwing a retryable timeout error. It does not bound the separate, intentionally
    unbounded wait that `destroy()`/`shutdown()` make for in-flight backups, checkpoints, or other
    async work still using the database — see [`db.destroy()`](#dbdestroy-void). Defaults to `30`
    seconds and must be a positive integer.
  - `verificationTableEntries: number` The number of slots in the process-global
    [Verification Table](#verification-table). Each slot is 8 bytes, so the default of `131072`
    (128K) slots is 1 MB. Set to `0` to disable the verification table. This must be configured
    before the first database is opened; once the table is materialized, attempts to change this
    value throw.
  - `writeBufferManagerAllowStall: boolean` When `true`, writes are stalled once the manager's
    `buffer_size` is exceeded, providing a hard cap on memtable memory. When `false`, memtables are
    allowed to grow past the limit and flushes are simply scheduled more aggressively. Off by
    default to favor write throughput over hard memory bounding. Defaults to `false`. A stall here
    is invisible to RocksDB's own stall counters and to
    [`db.isWriteStalled()`](#dbiswritestalled-boolean) — see
    [`getWriteBufferManagerStats()`](#getwritebuffermanagerstats-writebuffermanagerstats),
    which also describes the watchdog that logs a sustained stall.
  - `writeBufferManagerCostToCache: boolean` When `true`, memtable memory is "charged" against the
    shared block cache so the block cache and write buffers draw from a single pool. During write
    bursts the cache shrinks to make room for memtables; once memtables flush, the cache can grow
    back into the reclaimed space. Defaults to `false`.
  - `writeBufferManagerSize: number` Total memtable memory limit (bytes) shared across every
    database opened in this process. When set, RocksDB uses a single `WriteBufferManager` so write
    buffers are bounded process-wide rather than per database. Defaults to `0`, which means no
    manager. Setting `0` later stops _new_ opens from attaching one, but does not detach or resize
    the manager a database already holds — `write_buffer_manager` is fixed for the life of an open
    database, so its memtables stay charged against that budget.

```typescript
RocksDatabase.config({
	blockCacheSize: 100 * 1024 * 1024, // 100MB
	compactOnClose: true,
	writeBufferManagerAllowStall: false,
	writeBufferManagerCostToCache: false,
	writeBufferManagerSize: 64 * 1024 * 1024, // 64MB
});
```

### `getWriteBufferManagerStats(): WriteBufferManagerStats`

Reads the live state of the `WriteBufferManager`.

**Process-wide, not per-database.** The manager is a singleton shared by every database opened in
this process, `worker_threads` included, so these values describe the whole process regardless of
where the call was made.

- `enabled: boolean` Whether a manager has been created. `bufferSize`, `memoryUsage`,
  `mutableMemoryUsage`, `stallActive`, `stallActiveMs`, `watchdogRunning` and `columnFamilies` are
  `0`/`false` when not; `allowStall` and `costToCache` still reflect the configured setting (a
  manager is only created once `writeBufferManagerSize` is also set), and `inventoryAvailable` is
  `true` (there is nothing to fail to collect).
- `bufferSize: number` The budget in bytes (`writeBufferManagerSize`, read live).
- `memoryUsage: number` Total memtable memory in bytes charged against the manager.
- `mutableMemoryUsage: number` The share of `memoryUsage` held by active (mutable) memtables; the
  rest is memtables awaiting flush plus retained write history.
- `allowStall: boolean`, `costToCache: boolean` The manager's configuration.
- `stallActive: boolean` Whether the manager is currently stalling writes.
- `stallActiveMs: number` How long the current stall has been active; `0` when not stalled.
  Sampled once a second by the watchdog, so `0` for a stall's first second and whenever
  `watchdogRunning` is `false`.
- `watchdogRunning: boolean` Whether the stall watchdog thread is running.
- `columnFamilies: number` Live column families across every database attached to this manager. A
  dropped column family keeps charging the manager until its last handle closes, so it is counted
  until then.
- `inventoryAvailable: boolean` `false` when the inventory could not be collected because the
  database registry or a column-family inventory was locked. The two inventory fields are then
  empty and everything else is still live; the call never blocks on database work that may itself
  be stalled.
- `maxWriteBufferSizeToMaintain: Record<string, number>` Effective per-column-family retained-history
  target (as a decimal string) to how many of those column families carry it. Effective, not
  requested: RocksDB rewrites a requested `0` for a transaction database.

`bufferSize`, `memoryUsage`, `mutableMemoryUsage`, `stallActive` and `stallActiveMs` are also in
[`db.getStats()`](#dbgetstatsall-boolean-rocksdbstats) and `db.getStat()` under the same
`writeBufferManager.` prefix, for scraping; `enabled`, `allowStall`, `costToCache`,
`watchdogRunning`, and the column-family inventory are only here, because collecting them either
walks the database registry or isn't scrape-shaped.

`stallActive` is the signal that distinguishes a stalled process from an idle one.
[`db.isWriteStalled()`](#dbiswritestalled-boolean), the [`'writeStall'` event](#event-writestall)
and `rocksdb.stall.micros` all track RocksDB's `WriteController`, which a `WriteBufferManager`
stall never goes through.

#### The stall watchdog

While a manager exists with `writeBufferManagerAllowStall`, one low-frequency thread samples the
manager once a second. When a stall has been continuously active past
`ROCKSDB_JS_WBM_STALL_WARN_MS` (default `5000`; `0` disables the watchdog) it writes **one** line
to `stderr` and emits it as a process-wide `'log.warn'` event — once per stall episode, not per
blocked writer and not per sample:

```
[rocksdb-js] WriteBufferManager write stall active for 5.0s - no write can complete until memtable
memory drops below the budget. budget=661.2MB usage=662.2MB (100.2%) mutable=12.4MB (1.9%)
allowStall=true costToCache=true columnFamilies=28 maxWriteBufferSizeToMaintain={268435456:28}
```

It needs its own thread because every other candidate is blocked by the very condition it reports:
a writer is parked inside RocksDB, RocksDB's stall callbacks are `WriteController`-only, and a JS
timer cannot fire on a thread parked in a synchronous write. The line goes to `stderr` as well as
the event so it is not lost when nothing has registered a `'log.warn'` listener; route one and
ignore `stderr` if you would rather have it in your own log.

```typescript
RocksDatabase.on('log.warn', (message) => logger.warn(message));

const wbm = getWriteBufferManagerStats();
if (wbm.stallActive) {
	logger.warn(`writes stalled for ${wbm.stallActiveMs}ms: ${wbm.memoryUsage}/${wbm.bufferSize}`);
}
```

### `db.isOpen(): boolean`

Returns `true` if the database is open, otherwise false.

```typescript
console.log(db.isOpen()); // true or false
```

### `db.logOptions: { maxLogFileSize: number, infoLogLevel: number }`

Returns the informational-log settings currently in effect for this database, read live from
RocksDB. These are database-wide settings (not per-column-family). `maxLogFileSize` is the
per-file size cap for informational log files (`LOG` / `LOG.old.*`); `infoLogLevel` is the logging
verbosity. The database must be open.

```typescript
const db = RocksDatabase.open('path/to/db', { maxLogFileSize: 4 * 1024 * 1024 });
console.log(db.logOptions); // { maxLogFileSize: 4194304, infoLogLevel: 1 }
```

### `db.name: string`

Returns the database column family's name.

```typescript
const db = new RocksDatabase('path/to/db');
console.log(db.name); // 'default'

const db2 = new RocksDatabase('path/to/db', { name: 'users' });
console.log(db.name); // 'users'
```

### `db.open(): RocksDatabase`

Opens the database at the given path. This must be called before performing any data operations.

```typescript
import { RocksDatabase } from '@harperfast/rocksdb-js';

const db = new RocksDatabase('path/to/db');
db.open();
```

There's also a static `open()` method for convenience that performs the same thing:

```typescript
const db = RocksDatabase.open('path/to/db');
```

### `db.secondaryPath: string | undefined`

The secondary instance's workspace directory when the database was opened as a
[secondary](#new-rocksdatabasepath-options) (a read-only follower of a live primary), or
`undefined` for a regular or plain read-only open.

```typescript
const follower = RocksDatabase.open('/path/to/database', {
	secondaryPath: '/path/to/follower-workspace',
});
console.log(follower.secondaryPath); // '/path/to/follower-workspace'
console.log(follower.readOnly); // true
```

### `db.status: 'opened' | 'closed'`

Returns a string `'opened'` or `'closed'` indicating if the database is opened or closed.

```typescript
console.log(db.status);
```

### `db.use(name, options?): RocksDatabase`

Returns a `RocksDatabase` bound to the `name` column family of this same database, opening — and
creating, if it does not exist — the column family on first use. This is a factory (like
[`useLog`](#dbuselogname-transactionlog)), not a stateful switch: the returned view is an
independent instance whose own reads and writes target its column family, while sharing the same
underlying database. Because a single RocksDB database backs every column family, a transaction,
backup, or checkpoint still spans all of them.

- `name: string` The column family name.
- `options?: object` Options for the column family (same shape as the constructor's, minus `name`),
  overriding the options inherited from this database. Options only take effect when the view is
  (re)opened.

`use()` is get-or-create, backed by a weak cache: `db.use('events') === db.use('events')` while the
view is still referenced **and open**, and calling with this database's own column-family name
returns `this`. A view that has been closed (or garbage-collected — the cache does not pin it) is
transparently recreated on the next `use()`. Views are independent handles: closing this database
does not close them (and vice versa); the underlying database stays open until every handle is closed
or collected.

The view's store is derived by `Store#createColumnFamilyStore(name, options)`, which builds an
independent store of the same class with **its own codec state** — views never share a mutable
encoder/decoder. Consequently a database configured with a _pre-constructed_ encoder/decoder instance
cannot derive views (its `name`/`structures` would be shared and corrupt both column families); use an
encoder factory (`{ Encoder }`) or a named `encoding` instead. A custom `Store` whose constructor
can't be recreated from `(path, options)` (e.g. it takes injected dependencies) should override
`createColumnFamilyStore` to build its views.

```typescript
const db = RocksDatabase.open('path/to/db');

const events = db.use('events');
await events.put('e1', payload);

await db.put('k', 'v'); // default column family, unaffected
console.log(events.get('e1')); // payload
console.log(db.get('e1')); // undefined — different column family

events.close();
db.close();
```

## Data Operations

### `db.catchUpWithPrimary(): Promise<void>`

Advances a [secondary instance](#new-rocksdatabasepath-options) to the primary's current state by
tailing and replaying the primary's MANIFEST and WAL. A secondary does not see the primary's
writes — flushed or not — until it catches up. Reads through the handle remain safe while the
catch-up runs; catch-ups on the same database are serialized internally.

Throws with code `ERR_NOT_SECONDARY` on a database that was not opened with `secondaryPath`.
Column families the primary created after the secondary opened stay invisible until the secondary
reopens; ones the primary dropped remain readable until then. Catch-up advances the **database**
view only: transaction-log reads through a secondary serve the stores discovered at open, and a
store the primary creates afterward becomes visible only on reopen. Whether entries appended to an
already-open store are visible depends on where the writer is: a cross-process primary's appends
are not (the reader's view of the file extent is fixed at open), while a writer in the _same_
process shares the store object, so its appends are. Either way a log entry can describe data the
database view does not have yet — the log write completes before the RocksDB commit for every
writer, so log-leads-database is the normal direction and a consumer has to tolerate it. Serialize
catch-up calls per database. Each async call holds a libuv worker for the whole replay, and
concurrent calls queue on an internal per-database mutex while holding theirs, so a handful of
overlapping catch-ups on a backlogged follower can exhaust the default four-thread pool and stall
unrelated `fs`/`dns`/`crypto` work in the process. Await one before starting the next rather than
firing one per timer tick.

```typescript
const primary = RocksDatabase.open('/path/to/database');
const follower = RocksDatabase.open('/path/to/database', {
	secondaryPath: '/path/to/follower-workspace',
});

primary.putSync('foo', 'bar');
console.log(follower.getSync('foo')); // undefined — not caught up yet
await follower.catchUpWithPrimary();
console.log(follower.getSync('foo')); // 'bar'
```

### `db.catchUpWithPrimarySync(): void`

Synchronous version of `catchUpWithPrimary()`. The replay runs on the JS thread, so prefer the
async form unless the caller is already blocking.

```typescript
follower.catchUpWithPrimarySync();
```

### `db.clear(options?): Promise<number>`

Asychronously removes all data in the current database.

- `options: object`
  - `batchSize?: number` The number of records to remove at once. Defaults to `10000`.

Returns the number of entries that were removed.

Note: This does not remove data from other column families within the same database path.

```typescript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	db.putSync(`key${i}`, `value${i}`);
}
const entriesRemoved = await db.clear();
console.log(entriesRemoved); // 10
```

### `db.clearSync(options?): number`

Synchronous version of `db.clear()`.

- `options: object`
  - `batchSize?: number` The number of records to remove at once. Defaults to `10000`.

```typescript
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	db.putSync(`key${i}`, `value${i}`);
}
const entriesRemoved = db.clearSync();
console.log(entriesRemoved); // 10
```

### `db.compact(options?): Promise<void>`

Compacts a range of keys in the database. In RocksDB, deleted keys are not immediately removed from
the database. Instead, they are marked as deleted and a tombstone is written. This function
triggers a manual compaction which removes the tombstones and reclaims space. Only one compaction
per database path can be performed at a time.

- `options: object`
  - `start?: Key` The start key of the range to compact.
  - `end?: Key` The end key of the range to compact.
  - `bottommost?: boolean` Also compact the bottommost level, rewriting every file in range.
    RocksDB skips that level by default when no compaction filter is installed, and it holds most
    of the data — so an ordinary compaction leaves it untouched. Because a changed
    [`compression`](#compression) algorithm governs only newly written files, this is the way to
    re-encode data that already exists. It rewrites the whole range regardless of whether RocksDB
    considers it worthwhile, so it costs as much as the data is large. Defaults to `false`.

```typescript
await db.compact();

await db.compact({ start: 'a', end: 'z' });

// Re-encode everything already on disk under the column family's current codec
await db.compact({ bottommost: true });
```

On a [read-only](#new-rocksdatabasepath-options) database this is a no-op: arguments are still
validated, but the returned promise resolves without compacting rather than rejecting.

### `db.compactSync(options?): void`

Synchronous version of `compact()`. On a [read-only](#new-rocksdatabasepath-options) database it
validates its arguments and then returns without compacting, rather than throwing.

```typescript
db.compactSync();

db.compactSync({ start: 'a', end: 'z' });

db.compactSync({ bottommost: true });
```

### `db.destroy(): void`

Completely removes a database based on the `db` instance's path including all data, column families,
and files on disk. Destruction owns the physical path for the process: it closes every writable and
read-only handle for that path, waits for registered backups and checkpoints to stop using the
native database, and prevents another handle from reopening the path until removal finishes. Those
waits are synchronous and can outlive `lifecycleWaitSeconds` once destruction has claimed the path,
because releasing the native database beneath an active copy would be unsafe.

A previously opened instance does not need to remain open, which allows an explicit `destroy()`
retry after failed physical cleanup. A never-opened or read-only instance cannot destroy the
database. `shutdown()` reports a pending cleanup tombstone but never retries deletion; only an
explicit `destroy()` can remove the path.

```typescript
db.destroy();
console.log(fs.existsSync(db.path)); // false
```

### `db.drop(): Promise<void>`

Drops the column family the database was opened with (`name`). For the default column family this
clears all entries instead.

```typescript
const db = RocksDatabase.open('path/to/db', { name: 'users' });
await db.drop();
db.close();
```

#### Dropping column families

A drop retires the column family **logically** before it returns: the name is gone from
`db.columns`, a later `open()` with the same name creates a fresh, empty column family, and any
transaction that then stages a write to a handle of the dropped family, or commits one it staged
earlier, is refused whole with `ERR_COLUMN_FAMILY_DROPPED` (`Column family "users" was dropped`).
That terminal refusal releases the transaction's verification-table intents and bars further
writes or commit attempts; retained reads continue until the caller aborts the transaction, and
they still serve that transaction's own staged writes — values no commit will ever produce. A
caller that catches the refusal instead of letting it propagate must not read a value back through
the transaction and carry it forward.
If a staging call fails while the generation is being retired, retirement takes precedence and the
transaction is refused whole even when the immediate RocksDB failure was a pessimistic lock timeout.
Handles other threads still hold keep **reading** the dropped data until they close; a
non-transactional `putSync`/`removeSync` through such a handle is discarded.

The **physical** RocksDB drop is deferred behind commits already admitted when the drop lands: a
commit claims every column family its batch names before it writes its transaction-log batch and
releases them after RocksDB has applied it, and the physical drop runs from whichever
side releases last (or, for a commit a mid-flight `close()` tore out of its pipeline, from the next
drop, open of that name, or close on the database). With no such commit (the common case) `drop()`/`dropSync()` perform the
physical drop before returning, exactly as before. This is what keeps a drop racing another
thread's commit from latching RocksDB's fatal `Invalid column family specified in write batch`
error on the whole database.

Consequences to know about:

- A commit admitted before the drop completes successfully into the retiring generation, then the
  physical drop removes that generation. Its caller sees a successful commit, but those writes are
  intentionally discarded with the rest of the dropped column family; a same-name reopen creates
  a fresh, empty generation. If the transaction writes to a transaction log, its entries are still
  published; consumers must order the schema drop after those entries.
- `open()` of a name whose previous generation is still held by an admitted commit waits for the
  full admission-to-reclamation interval (bounded by `ROCKSDB_JS_CF_RECLAIM_WAIT_MS`, default
  `30000`) before creating the fresh column family; if the previous generation's physical drop
  failed, the open retries it once and throws with that error if it fails again.
- A physical drop that fails (an I/O error writing the MANIFEST) keeps the name retired, is
  retried on the next drop on the database, the next `open()` of that name, or close, and is
  reported through the global `log.warn` event and the `columnFamily.pendingReclaims` stat. When
  the failing drop was the one `drop()` itself ran, the call rejects with that error as well.

What is **not** guaranteed: a process that exits while a physical drop is still pending, or
after one failed, leaves the column family on disk under its name, and the next open of the
database opens it as a live column family. A backup or checkpoint taken inside that window copies
it. Callers that need a drop to survive a crash record their own durable tombstone before
acknowledging it.

### `db.dropSync(): void`

Synchronous version of `db.drop()`, with the same deferral contract.

```typescript
const db = RocksDatabase.open('path/to/db');
db.dropSync();
db.close();
```

### `db.flush(options?): Promise<void>`

Flushes all in-memory data to disk asynchronously.

- `options: object`
  - `allowWriteStall?: boolean` Whether the flush may proceed even though it will stall writes for
    its duration. Defaults to `false`, which — despite how that reads — means the flush **waits**
    until it can run without causing a stall, with no timeout: on a database stuck in a stall
    condition (immutable-memtable backlog, L0 stop trigger, an exhausted `WriteBufferManager`
    budget), the returned promise never settles, and since `flush()` runs on the libuv threadpool
    (default size 4), a handful of concurrently stalled flushes can exhaust the pool and stall
    every unrelated `fs`/`dns`/`crypto` call and cold-cache `get()` in the process, not only this
    database's. Pass `true` up front, before issuing a flush you expect might stall, when it's a
    durability gate you'd rather have stall writers than wait indefinitely — there's no way to
    cancel an in-flight `flush()`, so this isn't a rescue for one already hung, and forcing the
    memtable switch can itself prolong an existing L0 stop-trigger condition rather than clear it.
    That cost is database-wide, covering every column family on the (process-global,
    `worker_threads`-shared) database handle, not just the caller's — and it relocates the hang
    rather than removing it: a stalled write blocks the database's single commit thread, which
    dispatches every `Transaction.commit()` in order, so every commit behind it queues up too,
    including ones from callers that never touched flush. This is a different knob from
    `writeBufferManagerAllowStall` (see [`new RocksDatabase()`](#new-rocksdatabasepath-options)
    options), with nearly opposite polarity: that one governs whether the `WriteBufferManager` may
    stall writers at all, this one governs whether one manual flush is willing to cause a stall
    rather than wait one out.

```typescript
await db.flush();

// Chosen up front, as a durability gate willing to pay the stall cost
await db.flush({ allowWriteStall: true });
```

On a [read-only](#new-rocksdatabasepath-options) database this is a no-op: the options bag is still
validated, but the returned promise resolves without flushing rather than rejecting.

### `db.flushSync(options?): void`

Flushes all in-memory data to disk synchronously. Note that this can be an expensive operation, so
it is recommended to use `flush()` if you want to keep the event loop free.

- `options: object` Same as [`flush()`](#dbflushoptions-promisevoid). The default
  `allowWriteStall: false` wait is taken on the calling thread, which here is the JS thread — so
  the hazard described there is strictly larger on this entry point, not smaller: instead of
  parking one libuv pool worker it freezes the event loop outright, and it holds the in-flight
  operation claim that `close()` waits on, so the database cannot be closed out from under it
  either. Prefer `flush()` if there is any chance the database is in a stall condition.

```typescript
db.flushSync();

db.flushSync({ allowWriteStall: true });
```

On a [read-only](#new-rocksdatabasepath-options) database it validates its options and then returns
without flushing, rather than throwing.

### `db.get(key: Key, options?: GetOptions): MaybePromise<any>`

Retreives the value for a given key. If the key does not exist, it will resolve `undefined`.

```typescript
const result = await db.get('foo');
assert.equal(result, 'foo');
```

If the value is in the memtable or block cache, `get()` will immediately return the value
synchronously instead of returning a promise.

```typescript
const result = db.get('foo');
const value = result instanceof Promise ? await result : result;
assert.equal(result, 'foo');
```

Note that all errors are returned as rejected promises.

See [`GetOptions`](#getoptions) for the available options.

When the `expectedVersion` option is set and the [Verification Table](#verification-table) records
a matching version for the key, `get()` returns the `FRESH_VERSION_FLAG` sentinel
(`constants.FRESH_VERSION_FLAG`) instead of reading the value — signalling that any value the
caller has already cached for this key is still fresh and no read was performed. Be sure to check
for this sentinel before treating the result as a value:

```typescript
import { constants } from '@harperfast/rocksdb-js';

const result = db.get(key, { expectedVersion: cachedEntry.version });
if (result === constants.FRESH_VERSION_FLAG) {
	// the cached value is still valid; no read occurred
	return cachedEntry.value;
}
```

### `db.getSync(key: Key, options?: GetOptions): any`

Synchronous version of `get()`. Like `get()`, this can return the `FRESH_VERSION_FLAG` sentinel when
the `expectedVersion` option is used.

### `db.getEntry(key: Key, options?: GetOptions): MaybePromise<Entry | undefined>`

Retrieves the value for a given key together with the two clock words of its header, as
`{ value, localTime, version }`. `value` is decoded exactly as `get()` decodes it, and the same
options apply, including the `FRESH_VERSION_FLAG` sentinel described above. A missing key resolves
`undefined`.

```typescript
const entry = await db.getEntry('foo');
console.log(entry.localTime); // 1764307857213.739 — the transaction that wrote it
console.log(entry.version); // the record version
```

The two words come from the value's header, the same bytes the
[Verification Table](#verification-table) reads:

- **`localTime`** is the first word: the timestamp of the transaction that wrote the value, which is
  also the key of the transaction-log batch that recorded the write. It is the value's write
  identity within this node's log — [`db.useLog(name).query({ start: localTime })`](#dbuselogname)
  seeks the entry at exactly that key.
- **`version`** is the record version: the distinct second word when the producer set
  `HAS_DISTINCT_VERSION_FLAG` in the metadata word, and otherwise the same value as `localTime`.

Both are `undefined` for a value with no header word, and `version` alone is `undefined` when the
flag is set but the value does not carry a usable second word. rocksdb-js does not write these
bytes; a producer does. See [Verification Table](#verification-table) for the layout and
`constants.HAS_DISTINCT_VERSION_FLAG` for the flag.

### `db.getEntrySync(key: Key, options?: GetOptions): Entry | undefined`

Synchronous version of `getEntry()`.

### `db.getEstimatedKeyCount(): number`

Retrieves the estimated number of keys in the database. This is an alias for
`db.getDBIntProperty('rocksdb.estimate-num-keys')`; use `estimateCount()` for range support and a
confidence indicator.

```typescript
const estimated = db.getEstimatedKeyCount();
console.log(estimated);
```

### `db.estimateCount(options?: CountEstimateOptions): CountEstimate`

Estimates the number of keys in the database, or within a key range, returning
`{ count, confidence }`. Unlike `getKeysCount()`, this never iterates: the estimate is derived
from RocksDB statistics (memtable stats plus approximate SST sizes converted through the entry
density of the SSTs overlapping the range), so its cost scales with the number of SSTs overlapping
the range rather than the number of keys. Reading cold table properties can do I/O through the
table cache, so narrow ranges are preferable. A start-only range is computed as the
whole-database estimate minus the complement, so it does the work of the range _below_ `start`.
Accuracy improves with range size. Resolution is bounded by SST data-block granularity, so a range
narrower than a block is unreliable in either direction: it may over-report or report 0 for present
keys, and its low `confidence` is the signal. Recently deleted or overwritten entries may be counted
until compaction.
Estimates always reflect committed state; writes pending in a transaction are not included. Set
`reverse: true` to use `getRange()`'s reverse convention (`start` is the upper bound and `end` is
the lower bound). An inverted range (`start` ≥ `end`) returns
`{ count: 0, confidence: 1 }`.

`confidence` is a heuristic 0–1 indicator of how trustworthy `count` is — exactly 1 only when the
count is exact. It is derived from the estimate's resolution (data-block/memtable-sampling
granularity relative to the count), the tombstone fraction of the overlapping SSTs, and — for
start-only ranges — the error compounded by complement subtraction. Treat it as an ordering
signal (e.g. when to trust an estimate for query planning vs fall back to a heuristic), not a
statistical bound.

```typescript
const { count, confidence } = db.estimateCount({ start: 'a', end: 'z' });
```

### `db.createCountEstimator(options?: CountEstimatorOptions): CountEstimator`

Creates an estimator that progressively refines a range count estimate while the range is being
iterated — useful for reporting a total alongside a page of results without scanning the full
range. Before any traversal, `estimate()` returns the pure statistical estimate (same as
`estimateCount(range)`). As the caller reports progress with `advance(lastKey, count)` (e.g. once
per page), `estimate()` returns the exact traversed count plus a statistical estimate of the
remainder, calibrated by the observed ratio of actual-to-estimated entries over the portion
already traversed — so the count converges toward the exact total. `confidence` is the
exactness-weighted blend of the traversed portion and the remainder's confidence, so it approaches 1
as the exact portion grows, although a checkpoint may decrease when calibration makes a large
correction.
Each checkpoint reads committed state, so a traversal performed against a transaction snapshot may
be calibrated against data committed after that snapshot.
When traversal completes, call `finish()` and `estimate()` returns the exact count with
confidence 1. Reverse ranges follow `getRange`: set `start` to the upper bound and `end` to the
lower bound, then set `reverse: true`. The caller owns the progress contract: cursors must move
monotonically through the range and each entry must be reported exactly once.

```typescript
const range = { start: 'a', end: 'z' };
const estimator = db.createCountEstimator(range);
let lastKey;
let pageSize = 0;
for (const { key } of db.getRange({ ...range, limit: 25 })) {
	lastKey = key;
	pageSize++;
}
estimator.advance(lastKey, pageSize);
const { count, confidence } = estimator.estimate();
```

### `db.getKeys(options?: IteratorOptions): ExtendedIterable`

Retrieves all keys within a range.

```typescript
for (const key of db.getKeys()) {
	console.log(key);
}
```

### `db.getKeysCount(options?: RangeOptions): number`

Retrieves the exact number of keys in a database or a range.

```typescript
const count = db.getKeysCount(); // estimated number of keys
const range = db.getKeysCount({ start: 'a', end: 'z' }); // exact number of keys in the range
```

### `db.getMonotonicTimestamp(): number`

Returns the current timestamp as a monotonically increasing timestamp in milliseconds represented as
a decimal number. This process-wide clock supplies each transaction's initial timestamp, which is
also the key of the transaction-log batch the transaction is written under.

```typescript
const ts = db.getMonotonicTimestamp();
console.log(ts); // 1764307857213.739
```

It is a wall-clock (Unix epoch) value made strictly increasing: on a tie or a backward step of the
host clock it advances by one floating-point ulp per call until the wall clock catches up. That
keeps transaction timestamps ordered and durable, but it does not measure elapsed time — after a
backward step, differences between two calls understate real time. Use
[`steadyClockNow()`](#steadyclocknow-number) for elapsed durations and deadlines.

#### Timestamp floor at open

The clock is monotonic within a process, not across restarts: a new process reads the wall clock
again, so a backward step between runs can reissue a timestamp that is already a batch key in this
node's transaction log. Opening with
[`timestampFloorLog`](#rocksdatabaseopenpath-string-options-object-rocksdatabase) raises the clock
above every batch key still durable in the named log before the database handle is returned, so no
transaction can be constructed below it.

Name only a log this process **originates**. A log written under a timestamp adopted from another
node — a replication receiver calling [`txn.setTimestamp()`](#txnsettimestampts-number-void) — is
keyed by that node's clock; seeding from it would ratchet this process's clock to the fastest of
those nodes at every restart, and there is no way for the database to tell the two kinds of log
apart on its own.

The named floor is fail closed: an unreadable segment, incomplete scan, malformed framing, or a key
more than ten years ahead of the wall clock refuses the opted-in open rather than reissuing a durable
batch key. The floor is process-wide, so it applies to every database open in the process.

### `db.getOldestSnapshotTimestamp(): number`

Returns a number representing a unix timestamp of the oldest unreleased snapshot.

Snapshots are only created during transactions. When the database is opened in optimistic mode (the
default), the snapshot will be created on the first read. When the database is opened in pessimistic
mode, the snapshot will be created on the first read or write.

```typescript
console.log(db.getOldestSnapshotTimestamp()); // returns `0`, no snapshots

const promise = db.transaction(async (txn) => {
	// perform a write to create a snapshot
	await txn.get('foo');
	await setTimeout(100);
});

console.log(db.getOldestSnapshotTimestamp()); // returns `1752102248558`

await promise;
// transaction completes, snapshot released

console.log(db.getOldestSnapshotTimestamp()); // returns `0`, no snapshots
```

### `db.getDBProperty(propertyName: string): string | undefined`

Gets a RocksDB database property as a string.

- `propertyName: string` The name of the property to retrieve (e.g., ) `'rocksdb.levelstats'`.

Returns `undefined` if the property is not found.

```typescript
const db = RocksDatabase.open('/path/to/database');
const levelStats = db.getDBProperty('rocksdb.levelstats');
const stats = db.getDBProperty('rocksdb.stats');
```

### `db.getDBIntProperty(propertyName: string): number | undefined`

Gets a RocksDB database property as an integer.

- `propertyName: string` The name of the property to retrieve (e.g., ) `'rocksdb.num-blob-files'`.

Returns `undefined` if the property is not found.

```typescript
const db = RocksDatabase.open('/path/to/database');
const blobFiles = db.getDBIntProperty('rocksdb.num-blob-files');
const numKeys = db.getDBIntProperty('rocksdb.estimate-num-keys');
```

### `db.isWriteStalled(): boolean`

Whether RocksDB is currently applying write backpressure to this database —
delaying (rate-limiting) or fully stopping writes. Reads the live
`rocksdb.is-write-stopped` and `rocksdb.actual-delayed-write-rate` properties.

This is the authoritative, live pull counterpart to the
[`'writeStall'` event](#event-writestall): the event pushes per-column-family
entries into a stall (rate-limited), while this reports the current state on
demand and can never be stale. It is **database-wide** — the write controller is
shared across every column family, so it answers "are writes stalled anywhere"
rather than for one column family.

```typescript
if (db.isWriteStalled()) {
	console.warn('writes are currently throttled or blocked');
}
```

### `db.getRange(options?: IteratorOptions): ExtendedIterable`

Retrieves a range of keys and their values. Supports both synchronous and asynchronous iteration.

```typescript
// sync
for (const { key, value } of db.getRange()) {
	console.log({ key, value });
}

// async
for await (const { key, value } of db.getRange()) {
	console.log({ key, value });
}

// key range
for (const { key, value } of db.getRange({ start: 'a', end: 'z' })) {
	console.log({ key, value });
}
```

Pass `transaction: txn` to iterate this column family through that transaction, exactly as
`get()` does with the same option: the iterator sees the transaction's staged writes and reads on its
snapshot, and range bounds apply to staged keys too. `getKeys()` and `getKeysCount()` accept it as
well. On a transaction (`txn.getRange()`) the transaction itself is the context and takes precedence
over a `transaction` option, as it does for `txn.get()`. Such an iterator is closed when the
transaction commits or aborts: a later `next()` throws, while `return()` stays a no-op. Opening a
range or counting through a transaction that has already started committing throws as well.

```typescript
await db.transaction(async (txn) => {
	await txn.put('c', 'staged');
	for (const { key, value } of db.getRange({ start: 'a', end: 'z', transaction: txn })) {
		console.log({ key, value }); // includes { key: "c", value: "staged" }
	}
});
```

### `db.getUserSharedBuffer(key: Key, defaultBuffer: ArrayBuffer, options?)`

Creates a new buffer with the contents of `defaultBuffer` that can be accessed across threads. This
is useful for storing data such as flags, counters, or any ArrayBuffer-based data.

- `options?: object`
  - `callback?: () => void` A optional callback is called when `notify()` on the returned buffer is
    called.

Returns a new `ArrayBuffer` with two additional methods:

- `notify()` - Invokes the `options.callback`, if specified.
- `cancel()` - Removes the callback; future `notify()` calls do nothing

Note: If a shared buffer already exists for the given `key`, the returned `ArrayBuffer` will
reference this existing shared buffer. The buffer lives as long as its column family is open (a
`drop()` discards it with the column family — except the default column family, which `drop()`
only clears, so its buffers survive): it is process-wide state, so a thread dropping or garbage
collecting its own view (or exiting) never resets it for the others. Because nothing is ever
evicted, key the buffer on a small fixed set of names rather than on unbounded data such as
record ids. The notify callback is removed when the `ArrayBuffer` it was registered with is
garbage collected, or by `cancel()`.

```typescript
const buffer = new Uint8Array(db.getUserSharedBuffer('isDone', new ArrayBuffer(1)));
done[0] = 0;

if (done[0] !== 1) {
	done[1] = 1;
}
```

```typescript
const incrementer = new BigInt64Array(
	db.getUserSharedBuffer('next-id', new BigInt64Array(1).buffer)
);
incrementer[0] = 1n;

function getNextId() {
	return Atomics.add(incrementer, 0, 1n);
}
```

### `db.put(key: Key, value: any, options?: PutOptions): Promise`

Stores a value for a given key.

```typescript
await db.put('foo', 'bar');
```

### `db.putSync(key: Key, value: any, options?: PutOptions): void`

Synchronous version of `put()`.

### `db.remove(key: Key): Promise`

Removes the value for a given key.

```typescript
await db.remove('foo');
```

### `db.removeSync(key: Key): void`

Synchronous version of `remove()`.

## Transactions

### `db.transaction<T>(callback: TransactionCallback<T>, options?: TransactionOptions): Promise<T>`

Executes all database operations within the specified callback within a single transaction. If the
callback completes without error, the database operations are automatically committed. However, if
an error is thrown during the callback, all database operations will be rolled back.

```typescript
import type { Transaction } from '@harperfast/rocksdb-js';
await db.transaction(async (txn: Transaction) => {
	await txn.put('foo', 'baz');
});
```

Additionally, you may pass the transaction into any database data method:

```typescript
await db.transaction(async (transaction: Transaction) => {
	await db.put('foo', 'baz', { transaction });
});
```

Note that `db.transaction()` returns whatever value the transaction callback returns:

```typescript
const isBar = await db.transaction(async (txn: Transaction) => {
	const foo = await txn.get('foo');
	return foo === 'bar';
});
console.log(isBar ? 'Foo is bar' : 'Foo is not bar');
```

### `db.transactionSync<T>(callback: TransactionCallback<T>, options?: TransactionOptions): T`

Executes a transaction callback and commits synchronously. Once the transaction callback returns,
the commit is executed synchronously and blocks the current thread until finished.

Inside a synchronous transaction, use `getSync()`, `putSync()`, and `removeSync()`.

```typescript
import type { Transaction } from '@harperfast/rocksdb-js';
db.transactionSync((txn: Transaction) => {
	txn.putSync('foo', 'baz');
});
```

### Optimistic and Pessimistic Modes

`rocksdb-js` supports two different transaction modes: optimistic and pessimistic. The default mode
is optimistic.

- Optimistic: Conflicts detected at commit time.
- Pessimistic: Conflicts throw immediately on detection.

When a database is opened in optimistic mode, transactions are not locked and can be retried if
they fail with a conflict. When a database is opened in pessimistic mode, transactions are aborted
and cannot be retried if they fail with a conflict.

Optimistic mode is the default mode and is recommended for most use cases. Pessimistic mode is
recommended for use cases where you need to know immediately if a conflict occurs.

If a database is opened in one mode, it cannot be opened in a different mode. An error will be
thrown when trying to open it in a different mode without closing the database first.

### `TransactionCallback<T>`

`(txn: Transaction, attempt: number) => T | PromiseLike<T>`

A sync or async function to encapsulate all of the transaction operations. Once the function is
executed, the transaction is automatically committed. If the function returns a value, it will be
returned from the transaction call.

The `txn` parameter is a `Transaction`. See the [Transaction](#class-transaction) section for more
details.

The `attempt` parameter is the number of times the transaction has been retried.

### `TransactionOptions`

- `coordinatedRetry?: boolean` When `true`, an `IsBusy` conflict at commit time is retried
  automatically instead of being rejected. Rather than retrying immediately and racing the
  conflicting transaction again, the retry waits until the conflicting transaction has committed and
  released its write intent, then re-runs the transaction body right away with no backoff delay.
  Requires the column family to be opened with `verificationTable: true`. See
  [Verification Table](#verification-table). Defaults to `false`.
- `disableSnapshot?: boolean` Whether to disable snapshots. Defaults to `false`.
- `maxRetries?: number` The maximum number of times to retry the transaction. Defaults to `3`.
- `retryOnBusy?: boolean` Whether to retry the transaction if the commit fails with `IsBusy`.
  Defaults to `true` when the transaction is bound to a transaction log, otherwise `false`.

### Transaction Retry Logic

The retry mechanism will only be active when the `retryOnBusy` option is `true` or when
`retryOnBusy` is `undefined` and the transaction is bound to a transaction log. The attempts starts
at `1` and ends at `maxRetries`.

When using a transaction log and the commit fails with `ERR_BUSY`, the transaction log will be in
a bad state and the transaction will need to be retried. If the max retries is reached or the
transaction is not retried, a `ERR_TRANSACTION_ABANDONED` error will be thrown.

Users should use the `attempt` transaction callback parameter to ensure duplicate transaction log
entries are not added.

When `coordinatedRetry: true`, the retry behavior changes for `IsBusy` conflicts: instead of
rejecting (or retrying immediately and potentially conflicting again), the commit waits until the
conflicting transaction has committed and released its write intent, then re-runs the transaction
body immediately with no backoff. This is still bounded by `maxRetries` — if the transaction has
not committed after the configured number of coordinated retries, the transaction is abandoned with
an `ERR_TRANSACTION_ABANDONED` error. Coordinated retry requires the column family to be opened with
`verificationTable: true`.

That wait is bounded so a conflicting transaction that is never committed or aborted cannot block
the commit forever: if the write intent has not been released after `ROCKSDB_JS_PARK_TIMEOUT_MS`
(default `5000`), the commit resolves anyway and consumes a retry attempt exactly as a real release
would. A conflicting transaction held for longer than roughly `maxRetries` times that timeout
therefore ends in `ERR_TRANSACTION_ABANDONED` rather than waiting indefinitely. Deployments where
waiting is preferable to failing should raise the timeout; there is no way to disable the bound.
In particular `0` does not disable it: `0`, negative, and unparseable values all fall back to the
`5000` default, and a value between `1` and `49` is clamped up to `50`.

### Class: `Transaction`

The transaction callback is passed in a `Transaction` instance which contains all of the same data
operations methods as the `RocksDatabase` instance plus:

- `txn.abandonWrites(): void` Releases the staged writes' verification-table write intents without
  closing the transaction, and bars any further writes or commit. Reads (including read-your-own-writes)
  keep working until the transaction is aborted.
- `txn.abort()` Rolls back and closes the transaction. This method is automatically called after the
  transaction callback returns, so you shouldn't need to call it, but it's ok to do so. Once called,
  no further transaction operations are permitted. Calling this method multiple times has no effect.
- `txn.commit(): Promise<void>` Asynchronously commits the transaction and closes the transaction.
- `txn.commitSync()` Synchronously commits and closes the transaction.
- `txn.getTimestamp(): number` Retrieves the transaction timestamp in milliseconds as a decimal. It
  defaults to a process-wide monotonic value assigned when the transaction was created.
- `txn.id: number` The read-only transaction ID. Transaction IDs are unique to the RocksDB database
  path, regardless the database name/column family.
- `txn.setTimestamp(ts?: number): void` Overrides the transaction timestamp in milliseconds. If
  called without a timestamp, it claims a fresh monotonic value. It must be called before staging
  any write or transaction-log entry, and a supplied value must be finite, positive, and below
  `8.64e15`.

#### `txn.abandonWrites(): void`

Releases the staged writes' verification-table (VT) write intents without closing the transaction,
and bars any further writes or commit (`commit()`/`commitSync()`/`put()`/`remove()`, including
database-context writes via `{ transaction: txn }`, all reject once called). Reads — including
read-your-own-writes — keep working until the transaction is aborted. Idempotent, and a no-op after
`abort()`.

Scope is VT intents only: RocksDB's own transaction locks (pessimistic mode) are still held until
the transaction is aborted.

This is for a transaction kept open only for its outstanding read iterators after its writes were
already committed elsewhere (e.g. replayed onto another transaction) — it lets the intents release
early so other writers' coordinated-retry commits stop parking on them, instead of waiting for the
handle's eventual `abort()`.

#### `txn.abort(): void`

Rolls back and closes the transaction. This method is automatically called after the transaction
callback returns, so you shouldn't need to call it, but it's ok to do so. Once called, no further
transaction operations are permitted.

#### `txn.commit(): Promise<void>`

Commits and closes the transaction. This is a non-blocking operation and runs on a background
thread. Once called, no further transaction operations are permitted.

#### `txn.commitSync(): void`

Synchronously commits and closes the transaction. This is a blocking operation on the main thread.
Once called, no further transaction operations are permitted.

#### `txn.getTimestamp(): number`

Retrieves the transaction timestamp in milliseconds since the Unix epoch as a decimal. It defaults
to a process-wide monotonic value assigned when the transaction was created. The transaction log
uses this timestamp as the batch key; producers may also encode it into their own record format.

#### `txn.id`

Type: `number`

The transaction ID, a positive integer no greater than `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`. Transaction IDs
are unique to the RocksDB database path, regardless the database name/column family.

#### `txn.setTimestamp(ts?: number): void`

Overrides the transaction timestamp in milliseconds since the Unix epoch. Replication receivers and
crash replay can use this to adopt an origin transaction's log key. If called without a timestamp,
it claims a fresh monotonic value.

The override must happen while the transaction is pending and before any database write or
transaction-log entry is staged. A log batch that has already been written keeps its timestamp
across a coordinated retry; reapplying that same timestamp remains idempotent while pending. A
supplied value must be finite, positive, and below `8.64e15`.

rocksdb-js does not define a record's value layout or version metadata. A producer that copies the
transaction timestamp into record bytes is responsible for calling `setTimestamp()` before reading
and encoding it.

```typescript
await db.transaction(async (txn) => {
	txn.setTimestamp(Date.now());
});
```

## Error Handling

### `db.getLastError(): BackgroundError | null`

Returns the most recent [`BackgroundError`](#event-error) observed on this database, or `null` when
none has occurred. This is the **pull** counterpart to the `'error'` [event](#event-error): use it
for an on-demand check (e.g. a health probe) or to catch an error that fired before a listener was
attached. The value is historical — it is **not** cleared by a successful
[`db.resume()`](#dbresume-void); reset it explicitly with
[`db.setLastError(null)`](#dbsetlasterrorerror-void). When the returned error's `writesDisabled` is
`true`, writes are stopped until recovery.

```typescript
const err = db.getLastError();
if (err?.writesDisabled) {
	// ...free disk space, then...
	db.resume();
}
```

### `db.setLastError(error?): void`

Sets or clears the last background error, mirroring the Win32 `SetLastError` / `GetLastError` pair.

- **Clear** — pass `null` (or no argument). [`db.getLastError()`](#dbgetlasterror-backgrounderror--null)
  then returns `null` and no event fires. This is how you reset the error after handling or
  recovering it (e.g. after [`db.resume()`](#dbresume-void)) — the equivalent of
  `SetLastError(ERROR_SUCCESS)`.
- **Set** — pass an object (`{ message, severity?, severityName?, writesDisabled?, reason?, reasonName? }`;
  `type` defaults to `'background'`). It is stored and the `'error'` [event](#event-error) fires with
  the reconstructed [`BackgroundError`](#event-error). Useful for surfacing an application-level
  "this database is unusable" state, and for deterministically exercising the error path in tests.

```typescript
// reset after recovery
db.resume();
db.setLastError(null);

// inject (e.g. in a test)
db.on('error', (err) => console.error(err.message));
db.setLastError({
	message: 'disk quota exceeded',
	severity: 2,
	severityName: 'hard',
	writesDisabled: true,
});
```

### `db.resume(): void`

Attempts to recover the database from a background error (see the `'error'` [event](#event-error))
by calling RocksDB's `DB::Resume()`. Call this after the underlying condition has cleared — e.g.
once disk space has been freed. On success writes are accepted again (and RocksDB can resume the
obsolete-file cleanup it was blocking); on failure — the condition has not actually cleared — it
throws with the RocksDB error and the database stays read-only. A no-op on a healthy database.

Runs synchronously and may briefly block, since recovery can re-flush memtables.

```typescript
db.on('error', (err) => {
	if (err.writesDisabled) {
		// ...free disk space, then...
		db.resume();
	}
});
```

## Events

### Event: `'aftercommit'`

The `'aftercommit'` event is emitted after a transaction has been committed and the transaction has
completed including waiting for the async worker thread to finish.

- `result: object`
  - `next: null`
  - `last: null`
  - `txnId: number` The id of the transaction that was just committed.

### Event: `'beforecommit'`

The `'beforecommit'` event is emitted before a transaction is about to be committed.

### Event: `'begin-transaction'`

The `'begin-transaction'` event is emitted right before the transaction function is executed.

### Event: `'committed'`

The `'committed'` event is emitted after the transaction has been written. When this event is
emitted, the transaction is still cleaning up. If you need to know when the transaction is fully
complete, use the `'aftercommit'` event.

### Event: `'error'`

When a write fails at the filesystem level — a full disk, an exhausted quota — RocksDB records a
background error and, for a hard-or-worse severity, stops accepting writes. The database emits an
`'error'` event carrying a `BackgroundError` so a consumer can observe it and recover in-process
instead of restarting. When `writesDisabled` is `true`, call
[`db.resume()`](#dbresume-void) after the underlying condition clears. Register the listener with
`db.on('error', ...)` before the database is put under load — or use the pull-based
[`db.getLastError()`](#dbgetlasterror-backgrounderror--null) to catch an error that fired earlier.

`BackgroundError` is a real `Error` subclass, exported from the package, so both
`err instanceof Error` and `err instanceof BackgroundError` hold. It extends `Error` with:

- `message: string` — the RocksDB error string.
- `name: string` — always `'BackgroundError'`.
- `type: string` — the error-class discriminator; always `'background'`.
- `severity: number` — the RocksDB `Status::Severity`: `1` soft, `2` hard, `3` fatal,
  `4` unrecoverable.
- `severityName: string` — `'soft'`, `'hard'`, `'fatal'`, or `'unrecoverable'`.
- `writesDisabled: boolean` — whether RocksDB has disabled writes on the database (`severity >= 2`).
  Only then is `resume()` warranted; a soft error is auto-recoverable and leaves writes enabled.
  Distinct from opening the database in read-only mode.
- `reason?: number` / `reasonName?: string` — the originating `BackgroundErrorReason`
  (e.g. `'flush'`, `'compaction'`), present when the error came from a reason-bearing callback.

```typescript
import { BackgroundError } from '@harperfast/rocksdb-js';

db.on('error', (err) => {
	if (err instanceof BackgroundError && err.writesDisabled) {
		console.error(`writes disabled (${err.severityName}): ${err.message}`);
	}
});
```

```typescript
db.on('error', (err) => {
	if (err.writesDisabled) {
		// Hard-or-worse: RocksDB has disabled writes on this database. They stay
		// disabled until you clear the underlying condition and call db.resume().
		console.error(`database writes disabled (${err.severityName}): ${err.message}`);
	} else {
		// Soft error: writes are NOT disabled and RocksDB will auto-recover. This
		// is typically a transient background hiccup (e.g. a retryable I/O error
		// during flush or compaction), surfaced for visibility only — no action
		// is required.
		console.warn(`recoverable background error (${err.severityName}): ${err.message}`);
	}
});
```

### Event: `'writeStall'`

Emitted when a column family **enters** a RocksDB write-stall — the push signal that writes are being
throttled or blocked (for example when `dbWriteBufferSize` is too small for the number of column
families and RocksDB thrashes on premature flushes). Listeners receive three string arguments:

- `columnFamily: string` — the column family that entered the stall (`'default'` for the primary).
- `previousCondition: string` — `'normal' | 'delayed' | 'stopped'`.
- `currentCondition: string` — `'delayed'` (writes rate-limited) or `'stopped'` (writes blocked until
  a flush frees a memtable/L0 slot).

The event is **rising-edge only and rate-limited** per column family. RocksDB oscillates a CF's stall
condition many times per second during a sustained stall, so the event fires when a CF _enters_ a
stall and then at most once per `ROCKSDB_JS_WRITE_STALL_DEBOUNCE_MS` (default 1000 ms) while it stays
stalling — never a flood. **Recovery is not pushed**: reliably distinguishing a brief dip from a real
recovery isn't possible without a timer, so for current state use the pull below rather than waiting
for a `'normal'` event.

For "are writes stalled right now?", call [`db.isWriteStalled()`](#dbiswritestalled-boolean) — it
reads the live write-controller state and is authoritative. Note it is **database-wide** (the write
controller is shared across all column families), so it answers "is anything stalling writes" while
the event names _which_ CF; a listener attached mid-stall should consult it rather than expect a
missed rising edge.

```typescript
db.on('writeStall', (cf, prev, cur) => {
	console.warn(`RocksDB write stall entered on ${cf}: ${prev} -> ${cur}`);
});
// ...and to check the current state on demand:
if (db.isWriteStalled()) console.warn('writes are currently throttled or blocked');
```

## Event API

`rocksdb-js` provides a EventEmitter-like API that lets you asynchronously notify events to one or
more synchronous listener callbacks. There are two types of events:

- Per-database events: scoped by database path.
- Process-global events: not scoped by database path.

Unlike `EventEmitter`, events are emitted asynchronously, but in the same order that the listeners
were added.

```typescript
// Process-global events
RocksDatabase.on('log.warn', console.warn);

RocksDatabase.on('foo', (...args) => {
	console.log(args);
});
RocksDatabase.notify('foo', 'bar');
RocksDatabase.off('foo', callback);

// Per-database events
const callback = (name) => console.log(`Hi from ${name}`);
db.addListener('foo', callback);
db.notify('foo');
db.notify('foo', 'bar');
db.removeListener('foo', callback);
```

### `addListener(event: string, callback: () => void): void`

Adds a listener callback for the specific key.

```typescript
db.addListener('foo', () => {
	// this callback will be executed asynchronously
});

db.addListener(1234, (...args) => {
	console.log(args);
});
```

### `listeners(event: string): number`

Gets the number of listeners for the given key.

```typescript
db.listeners('foo'); // 0
db.addListener('foo', () => {});
db.listeners('foo'); // 1
```

### `on(event: string, callback: () => void): void`

Alias for `addListener()`.

### `once(event: string, callback: () => void): void`

Adds a one-time listener, then automatically removes it.

```typescript
db.once('foo', () => {
	console.log('This will only ever be called once');
});
```

### `removeListener(event: string, callback: () => void): boolean`

Removes an event listener. You must specify the exact same callback that was used in
`addListener()`.

```typescript
const callback = () => {};
db.addListener('foo', callback);

db.removeListener('foo', callback); // return `true`
db.removeListener('foo', callback); // return `false`, callback not found
```

### `off(event: string, callback: () => void): boolean`

Alias for `removeListener()`.

### `notify(event: string, ...args?): boolean`

Call all listeners for the given key. Returns `true` if any callbacks were found, otherwise `false`.

Unlike `EventEmitter`, events are emitted asynchronously, but in the same order that the listeners
were added.

You can optionally emit one or more arguments. Note that the arguments must be serializable. In
other words, `undefined`, `null`, strings, booleans, numbers, arrays, and objects are supported.

```typescript
db.notify('foo');
db.notify(1234);
db.notify({ key: 'bar' }, { value: 'baz' });
```

## Statistics

Retrieve RocksDB statistics at runtime. You must set `enableStats: true` when calling `db.open()`.
Statistics are captured at the database level and include all column families.

RocksDB has two types of statistics: tickers and histograms. Tickers are 64-bit unsigned integers
that measure counters. Histograms are objects containing various measurements of statistic
distribution across all operations.

```typescript
import { RocksDatabase, stats } from '@harperfast/rocksdb-js';
const db = RocksDatabase.open('/path/to/db', {
	enableStats: true,
	statsLevel: stats.StatsLevel.ExceptDetailedTimers, // default
});
console.log(db.getStats());
```

### `db.getStat(statName: string): RocksDBStat`

Retrieves a single statistic value. Return value is either a `number` or `StatsHistogramData`
object.

```typescript
console.log(db.getStat('rocksdb.block.cache.miss'));
```

### `db.getStats(all?: boolean): RocksDBStats`

Returns an object containing a curated list of column family-level properties, internal tickers
stats, and internal histogram stats. Return value is an object with the stat name as the key and
a `RocksDBStat` as the value.

By default, it only returns the most meaningful internal stats. When `all = true`, it returns the
same column family-level properties, but includes all internal tickers and histogram stats.

Column family and ticker stat values are 64-bit unsigned integers and histogram values are
`StatsHistogramData` objects.

The result also always includes a summarized, aggregate set of `txnlog.*` keys covering all of
the database's transaction logs, and a set of `writeBufferManager.*` keys describing the
process-wide `WriteBufferManager`
([`getWriteBufferManagerStats()`](#getwritebuffermanagerstats-writebuffermanagerstats)
carries the same values plus its column-family inventory). Both sets are present regardless of
whether statistics are enabled and can be fetched individually with `db.getStat()`. For detailed, per-log statistics —
including memory-map usage — use [`log.getStats()`](#loggetstats-transactionlogstats). All stat
names are documented in [docs/stats.md](docs/stats.md).

```typescript
// get essential stats
console.log(db.getStats());

// get all stats
console.log(db.getStats(true));

// transaction log bytes across all logs
console.log(db.getStats()['txnlog.totalSizeBytes']);
```

### `stats`

An object containing stat-specific constants. The full catalog of available stat names (RocksDB
tickers, histograms, internal properties, and transaction log stats) is documented in
[docs/stats.md](docs/stats.md).

#### `stats.StatsLevel`

The `stats.StatsLevel` contains constants used to set which types of skip and reduce statistic overhead.

- `StatsLevel.DisableAll` Disable all metrics.
- `StatsLevel.ExceptTickers` Disable all tickers.
- `StatsLevel.ExceptHistogramOrTimers` Disable timer stats and skip histogram stats.
- `StatsLevel.ExceptTimers` Skip timer stats
- `StatsLevel.ExceptDetailedTimers` Skip time waiting for mutex locks and compression.
- `StatsLevel.ExceptTimeForMutex` Skip time waiting for mutex locks.
- `StatsLevel.All` Collects all stats.

### `type RocksDBStat = number | StatsHistogramData`

A `RocksDBStat` is either a `number` or `StatsHistogramData` object.

### `type RocksDBStats = Record<string, RocksDBStat>`

A `RocksDBStats` is an object with the stat name as the key and a `RocksDBStat` as the value.

### `type StatsHistogramData`

An object is a record with the following properties:

- `average: number` A double containing the average value.
- `count: number` An unsigned 64-bit integer containing the number of values.
- `max: number` A double containing the maximum value.
- `median: number` A double containing the median value.
- `min: number` A double containing the minimum value.
- `percentile95: number` A double containing the 95th percentile value.
- `percentile99: number` A double containing the 99th percentile value.
- `standardDeviation: number` A double containing the standard deviation.
- `sum: number` An unsigned 64-bit integer containing the sum of all values.

## Compression

RocksDB compresses data blocks in SST files (and, in `rocksdb-js`, blob files that hold large
values) using a configurable algorithm. Compression trades CPU for disk space and, because it
reduces bytes read from disk, often improves read throughput on I/O-bound workloads.

The following algorithm names are recognized. Which ones are actually usable depends on the native
build — see **Availability** below.

| Name     | Notes                                                                         |
| -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `none`   | No compression. Always available.                                             |
| `snappy` | Fast, modest ratio. RocksDB's own stock default when linked.                  |
| `zlib`   | Higher ratio, slower. Supports `level` (see zlib's manual).                   |
| `bzip2`  | High ratio, slow; rarely worth it over zstd.                                  |
| `lz4`    | Very fast, modest ratio. `rocksdb-js` default when available.                 |
| `lz4hc`  | LZ4 high-compression variant: better ratio, slower writes, same fast reads.   |
| `zstd`   | Best ratio-for-speed of the set; supports `level` (higher = smaller, slower). |

Set the algorithm per column family with the `compression` option when opening a database:

```typescript
// Algorithm name
const db = RocksDatabase.open('/path/to/db', { compression: 'zstd' });

// Or an object with an explicit level
const db2 = RocksDatabase.open('/path/to/db2', {
	compression: { algorithm: 'zstd', level: 3 },
});

// Disable compression entirely
const db3 = RocksDatabase.open('/path/to/db3', { compression: 'none' });
```

**Default.** When `compression` is omitted, `rocksdb-js` defaults to **LZ4** if the native build
supports it. LZ4 is fast with a modest compression ratio, making it a good general-purpose default.
If LZ4 is not compiled in, the default falls back to RocksDB's own default — Snappy when it is
linked, otherwise no compression. (RocksDB's stock default is Snappy; `rocksdb-js` overrides it to
LZ4.) Read the algorithm actually in effect with the `db.compression` getter.

**Availability.** The set of algorithms depends on which compression libraries the native binding
was compiled against, so it varies by build. Always check
[`supportedCompression`](#supportedcompression) at runtime — opening with an unavailable algorithm
throws. `'none'` is always available.

**Changing the codec of data already written.** Setting `compression` affects files written from
that point on. Existing SST and blob files keep the codec they were written with until something
rewrites them. An ordinary `compact()` can re-encode non-bottommost levels, but RocksDB leaves the
bottommost level alone unless a compaction filter is installed — and that is where most of the data
sits, so a plain compaction will not rewrite all existing data. Use
[`compact({ bottommost: true })`](#dbcompactoptions-promisevoid) to force the rewrite, once per
column family you want migrated. Note also that omitting `compression` on a column family that
already exists **inherits** its current codec rather than applying the default — the default
applies only when the family is created.

**Adopting a codec across a whole database.** Compression is chosen per column family, and RocksDB
opens every family of a database in one call — so by default the families you did not name keep
their persisted algorithm. If your first open targets some other family (a catalog, say), the rest
are already open at their old algorithm before you can ask for a new one, and a family's compression
cannot be changed while it is open. Pass `compressionForAllColumnFamilies: true` to apply the
requested algorithm to all of them instead:

```typescript
// Every column family in this database adopts lz4, not just 'catalog'
const db = RocksDatabase.open('/path/to/db', {
	name: 'catalog',
	compression: 'lz4',
	compressionForAllColumnFamilies: true,
});
```

It requires an explicit `compression`, and only takes effect on the open that creates the database
handle — later opens of the same path reuse that handle. As always the algorithm governs newly
written files; use [`compact({ bottommost: true })`](#dbcompactoptions-promisevoid) to rewrite what
is already there.

**Scope and mutability.** Compression is genuinely **per-column-family**. Each `RocksDatabase`
targets one column family (`name`), and its `compression` applies only to that CF — opening one CF
never changes another's algorithm, regardless of open order. A column family keeps its own
compression across a close/reopen (a plain reopen inherits it); the algorithm is dynamically
changeable, so an explicit change governs files written afterward while existing SST/blob files keep
their original compression until rewritten by compaction. It also applies to blob files (large
values), whose compression otherwise defaults to none.

Because a column family's compression is fixed while it is open, if the same column family is opened
a second time in the same process (another `RocksDatabase` on the same path/`name`, including from a
`worker_thread`) with an **explicitly different** algorithm or level, the second open **throws** — a
plain reopen (no `compression`) instead inherits the live setting.

### `supportedCompression`

A module-level, frozen array of the compression algorithm names compiled into the loaded native
binding. The set is fixed for a given binary. `'none'` is always present.

```typescript
import { supportedCompression } from '@harperfast/rocksdb-js';

console.log(supportedCompression); // e.g. ['none', 'snappy', 'lz4', 'zstd']

if (supportedCompression.includes('zstd')) {
	// safe to open with { compression: 'zstd' }
}
```

## Exclusive Locking

`rocksdb-js` includes a handful of functions for executing thread-safe mutually exclusive functions.

### `db.hasLock(key: Key): boolean`

Returns `true` if the database has a lock for the given key, otherwise `false`.

```typescript
db.hasLock('foo'); // false
db.tryLock('foo'); // true
db.hasLock('foo'); // true
```

### `db.tryLock(key: Key, onUnlocked?: () => void): boolean`

Attempts to acquire a lock for a given key. If the lock is available, the function returns `true`
and the optional `onUnlocked` callback is never called. If the lock is not available, the function
returns `false` and the `onUnlocked` callback is queued until the lock is released.

When a database is closed, all locks associated to it will be unlocked.

```typescript
db.tryLock('foo', () => {
	console.log('never fired');
}); // true, callback ignored

db.tryLock('foo', () => {
	console.log('hello world');
}); // false, already locked, callback queued

db.unlock('foo'); // fires second lock callback
```

The `onUnlocked` callback function can be used to signal to retry acquiring the lock:

```typescript
function doSomethingExclusively() {
	// if lock is unavailable, queue up callback to recursively retry
	if (db.tryLock('foo', () => doSomethingExclusively())) {
		// lock acquired, do something exclusive

		db.unlock('foo');
	}
}
```

### `db.unlock(key): boolean`

Releases the lock on the given key and calls any queued `onUnlocked` callback handlers. Returns
`true` if the lock was released or `false` if the lock did not exist.

```typescript
db.tryLock('foo');
db.unlock('foo'); // true
db.unlock('foo'); // false, already unlocked
```

### `db.withLock(key: Key, callback: () => void | Promise<void>): Promise<void>`

Runs a function with guaranteed exclusive access across all threads.

```typescript
await db.withLock('key', async () => {
	// do something exclusive
	console.log(db.hasLock('key')); // true
});
```

If there are more than one simultaneous lock requests, it will block them until the lock is
available.

```typescript
await Promise.all([
	db.withLock('key', () => {
		console.log('first lock blocking for 100ms');
		return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
	}),
	db.withLock('key', () => {
		console.log('second lock blocking for 100ms');
		return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 100));
	}),
	db.withLock('key', () => {
		console.log('third lock acquired');
	}),
]);
```

Note: If the `callback` throws an error, Node.js suppress the error. Node.js 18.3.0 introduced a
`--force-node-api-uncaught-exceptions-policy` flag which will cause errors to emit the
`'uncaughtException'` event. Future Node.js releases will enable this flag by default.

## File Locking

`rocksdb-js` includes helper functions for creating lock files and releasing them using native APIs.
This can be used to prevent multiple processes from concurrently accessing a resource. The lock is
automatically released when the process exits.

### `tryFileLock(file: string, shared?: boolean): number`

Attempts to acquire a lock on the given file, creating the file and any missing parent directories.
The lock is exclusive by default; pass `shared: true` for a shared (reader) lock, which coexists
with other shared holders but conflicts with an exclusive holder in either direction. Returns a
non-zero token to pass to `fileLockRelease` if the lock was acquired, or `0` if a conflicting
holder — in any process, container, or worker thread — currently has it. Throws on a hard error.

A shared lock needs only read access: it opens the file read-only and does not create it (falling
back to create only when the file is missing on a writable directory), so it can lock an existing
lock file on a read-only filesystem. If the media is read-only for every process (`EROFS` /
`ERROR_WRITE_PROTECT`) so the open fails outright, a shared acquire degrades to a successful no-op
token — there can be no exclusive holder to exclude on a directory nothing can write. A plain
permission denial (`EACCES` / `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`) is _not_ degraded — only the caller is blocked,
so a privileged holder may still exist — and throws instead. An exclusive lock always opens
read-write and creates the file, and so requires a writable location.

```typescript
import { tryFileLock } from '@harperfast/rocksdb-js';

const token = tryFileLock('/path/to/lock');
if (token) {
	console.log('lock acquired');
} else {
	console.log('lock not available, another process is holding it');
}
```

### `fileLockRelease(token: number): void`

Releases the file lock for the given token.

```typescript
import { fileLockRelease } from '@harperfast/rocksdb-js';

fileLockRelease(token);
```

## Verification Table

The verification table is a process-global, fixed-size structure that lets an application cheaply
check whether a value it has already cached is still fresh, without performing a full read. It is
intended for read-heavy workloads where records carry a monotonically increasing numeric version.

Each record's version is the numeric value stored in the first 8 bytes of its value (interpreted as
a big-endian float64). The table maps `(database, column family, key)` to a single 8-byte slot that
holds the last-known version for that key. Because slots are addressed by a hash, distinct keys may
share a slot; a collision only ever causes a conservative miss (a real read), never a stale value to
be treated as fresh.

This first word is the only version the table derives on its own: it is what a read with
`populateVersion: true` publishes and what a transaction write invalidates against. A producer whose
record format also carries a separately assigned version elsewhere in the value must keep using the
first word on both sides of the check — as `expectedVersion`, and as the argument to any explicit
[`db.populateVersion()`](#dbpopulateversionkey-key-version-number-void) call, which publishes
whatever it is given. Comparing against the other value would miss the fast path, and publishing it
would make the slot disagree with what the next write invalidates.

The freshness check works as follows:

1. Pass `{ expectedVersion }` to `get()` / `getSync()`. If the slot currently records that version,
   the read is skipped and the `FRESH_VERSION_FLAG` sentinel is returned.
2. On a cold read, pass `{ populateVersion: true }` (or call `db.populateVersion()` afterward) to
   seed the slot with the version extracted from the value, so subsequent freshness checks hit.

Transaction writes to a column family opened with `verificationTable: true` invalidate the slot for
each written key at write time, so a stale version can never survive a write. This is also what
enables [`coordinatedRetry`](#transactionoptions): a conflicting transaction parks on the slot and
retries once the write intent is released.

The table is **process-global** and backed by a single shared structure, so versions populated on
the main thread are visible to `worker_threads` workers and vice versa.

### Value-header contract

rocksdb-js does not define a record's value layout. It reads only a header a producer may choose to
write at the front of the value, and every byte of it is the producer's to fill in:

| Offset | Bytes | Meaning                                                                                                  |
| ------ | ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0      | 8     | First word: big-endian float64. The version the verification table keys on.                              |
| 8      | 4     | Metadata word: big-endian, top byte `0x0E` (`constants.VERSION_HEADER_TAG`), low 24 bits producer flags. |
| 12     | 8     | Second word: big-endian float64, present only under `HAS_DISTINCT_VERSION_FLAG`.                         |

The **first word** is the only version the table derives on its own. In a store whose producer sets
the transaction's timestamp there, it is also the key of the transaction-log batch the write was
recorded under, which is what lets a record find its own log entry.

Two flags in the metadata word are named by this library:

- `constants.VERSION_NOT_UNIQUE_FLAG` (`0x10000`) — the producer has stored more than one distinct
  value under this version, so version equality proves nothing about a cached copy. This is the one
  flag the native layer interprets: such a value is never answered `FRESH_VERSION_FLAG` and its
  version is never published to a slot.
- `constants.HAS_DISTINCT_VERSION_FLAG` (`0x20000`) — the value carries a record version distinct
  from the first word, in the second word at offset 12. Not interpreted natively; read it through
  [`db.getEntry()`](#dbgetentrykey-key-options-getoptions-maybepromiseentry--undefined), which
  returns both words. A value without the flag decodes as `version === localTime`, which is how a
  value written before the flag existed reads.

A producer that keeps a separately assigned version in the second word must still use the **first**
word on both sides of a freshness check — as `expectedVersion`, and as the argument to
`db.populateVersion()`, which publishes whatever it is given. Passing the record version instead
would miss the fast path, and publishing it would leave the slot disagreeing with what the next
write invalidates.

### Enabling the verification table

The table must be sized before the first database is opened, via the
[`verificationTableEntries`](#dbconfigoptions) config option (default `131072` slots = 1 MB; set to
`0` to disable). Then opt-in per column family with the `verificationTable: true` open option:

```typescript
import { RocksDatabase } from '@harperfast/rocksdb-js';

RocksDatabase.config({ verificationTableEntries: 128 * 1024 });

const db = RocksDatabase.open('path/to/db', { verificationTable: true });
```

Enable `verificationTable` only for column families whose records are cached (e.g. the primary
column family of a table); enabling it adds per-write slot invalidation overhead.

### `db.verifyVersion(key: Key, version: number): boolean`

Returns `true` when the verification table currently records `version` for `key` (in this database
and column family), indicating a cached value with that version is still fresh. Returns `false`
otherwise — including when the table is disabled. This is a cheap, synchronous check that performs
no database read.

```typescript
if (db.verifyVersion(key, cachedEntry.version)) {
	return cachedEntry.value;
}
const value = db.getSync(key);
db.populateVersion(key, extractVersion(value));
```

### `db.populateVersion(key: Key, version: number): void`

Seeds the verification-table slot for `key` with `version`. This is typically called after a full
read where the caller already knows the version. It has no effect if the slot is currently
lock-tagged (a transaction is mid-write on that key) or if the verification table is disabled.

Passing `{ populateVersion: true }` to `get()` / `getSync()` performs the equivalent seeding
automatically after a cold read, avoiding a separate call.

## Transaction Log

A user controlled API for logging transactions. This API is designed to be generic so that you can
log gets, puts, and deletes, but also arbitrary entries.

Transaction logs are isolated by the database path allowing different column families in the same
database to share the transaction log store, but not other databases.

### Memory-Map Handling

Transaction log files are read through read-only memory maps. Understanding how these maps interact
with system memory helps when interpreting [`log.getStats()`](#loggetstats-transactionlogstats)
figures and process memory usage:

- **Maps are created lazily and live until the file is closed.** Writing log entries does not map
  anything; a log file is mapped the first time a `log.query()` reads from it. The native layer
  holds each file's map for the life of the file — it is released when the log file is purged or
  the database is closed, not by garbage collection. JS `Buffer` views over the map (including
  `entry.data`) hold an additional reference, so the underlying memory is never unmapped while a
  view is still reachable. `stats.memory.activeMaps` counts the maps currently held by the native
  layer.
- **Mapped bytes are virtual, not resident.** Creating a map reserves address space only. A page
  consumes physical RAM (RSS) when it is first read (demand paging). Querying a multi-gigabyte log
  can show `memory.mappedBytes` in the gigabytes while actual memory usage barely moves.
- **Queries are zero-copy.** The iterator returned by `log.query()` reads only each entry's small
  header; `entry.data` is a `Buffer` view directly into the map (no copy). Payload pages are
  faulted into memory only if and when the entry data is actually read.
- **Resident pages are reclaimable.** Because the maps are read-only and file-backed, every
  resident page is "clean" — the kernel can evict it at any time under memory pressure and re-read
  it from disk on the next access. Mapped log data therefore lives in the page cache and cannot
  exhaust memory the way heap allocations can; a full scan of a log larger than RAM will simply
  cycle pages through the cache.

OS-specific differences:

- **POSIX (Linux and macOS):** The active write file is mapped at the full configured
  `transactionLogMaxSize` (an anonymous reservation with the file's contents overlaid on top), so
  `memory.mappedBytes` over-reports the active file; `memory.overlayBytes` is the file-backed
  portion and is the closer proxy for real consumption.
- **macOS:** Activity Monitor's "Memory" column reports the physical footprint, which excludes
  clean file-backed pages — mapped log data is essentially invisible there even when resident. Use
  process RSS (e.g. `process.memoryUsage().rss`, `ps`, or `vmmap <pid>`) to observe it.
- **Linux:** Resident map pages are visible in process RSS, and `/proc/<pid>/smaps` reports exact
  per-file `Rss`/`Pss` for each mapped `.txnlog` file.
- **Windows:** Maps are created with `CreateFileMapping`/`MapViewOfFile` at the file's current
  size. There is no overlay mechanism, so `memory.overlayBytes` is always `0`, and the active
  write file's map is not cached because it is not growable.

### `db.listLogs(): string[]`

Returns an array of log store names.

```typescript
const names = db.listLogs();
```

### `db.purgeLogs(options?): string[]`

### `db.purgeLogs({ includeEntryCounts: true, ...options }): { path: string; entries: number }[]`

Deletes transaction log files older than the `transactionLogRetention` (defaults to 3 days).
Ordinary retention keeps the sequence file named by `txn.state` and every newer file as the live
store's retention floor, or the highest sequence file when there is no persisted flush position. It
removes only an eligible contiguous prefix below that floor. An idle store can therefore retain one
file past the cutoff until a later write rotates and flushes it; that extra file is bounded by the
store's `transactionLogMaxSize` (except when a single transaction exceeds the target). That bound
covers only the floor file: when the flush position lags — `txn.state` stuck at an old sequence
because RocksDB flushing is behind — every file above the floor is retained too, which
`transactionLogMaxSize` does not bound. `purge.retainedUnflushedFiles` reports that case. Use
`destroy: true` only to remove the store itself.

- `options: object`
  - `before?: number` Remove transaction log files older than the specified timestamp, subject to
    the retention floor and contiguous-prefix rules above.
  - `destroy?: boolean` When `true`, deletes transaction log stores including all log sequence files
    on disk.
  - `includeEntryCounts?: boolean` When `true`, counts the entries in each deleted log file and
    returns an array of `{ path, entries }` objects instead of an array of file paths. Counting reads
    each file before it is removed, so it is only performed when this option is enabled.
  - `name?: string` The name of a store to limit the purging to.

The method is overloaded so the return type follows `includeEntryCounts`: by default (omitted or
`false`) it returns `string[]` — the full path of each log file deleted; when `includeEntryCounts` is
`true` it returns `{ path: string; entries: number }[]`, each entry being the `path` of the deleted
log file and the number of `entries` it held. Because of the overloads, the object-array form is
returned directly when `includeEntryCounts: true` is passed as a literal, with no casting required.

```typescript
const removed = db.purgeLogs();
console.log(`Removed ${removed.length} log files`);

// Include the entry count for each deleted log file:
const purged = db.purgeLogs({ includeEntryCounts: true });
for (const { path, entries } of purged) {
	console.log(`Removed ${path} (${entries} entries)`);
}
```

### `db.useLog(name): TransactionLog`

Gets or creates a `TransactionLog` instance. Internally, the `TransactionLog` interfaces with a
shared transaction log store that is used by all threads. Multiple worker threads can use the same
log at the same time.

- `name: string | number` The name of the log. Numeric log names are converted to a string.

```typescript
const log1 = db.useLog('foo');
const log2 = db.useLog('foo'); // gets existing instance (e.g. log1 === log2)
const log3 = db.useLog(123);
```

`Transaction` instances also provide a `useLog()` method that binds the returned transaction log to
the transaction so you don't need to pass in the transaction id every time you add an entry.

```typescript
await db.transaction(async (txn) => {
	const log = txn.useLog('foo');
	log.addEntry(Buffer.from('hello'));
});
```

### Class: `TransactionLog`

A `TransactionLog` lets you add arbitrary data bound to a transaction that is automatically written
to disk right before the transaction is committed. You may add multiple enties per transaction. The
underlying architecture is thread safe.

- `log.addEntry()`
- `log.path`
- `log.query()`

#### `log.addEntry(data, transactionId): void`

Adds an entry to the transaction log.

- `data: Buffer | UInt8Array` The entry data to store. There is no inherent limit beyond what
  Node.js can handle.
- `transactionId: Number` A related transaction used to batch entries on commit.

```typescript
const log = db.useLog('foo');
await db.transaction(async (txn) => {
	log.addEntry(Buffer.from('hello'), txn.id);
});
```

If using `txn.useLog()` (instead of `db.useLog()`), you can omit the transaction id from
`addEntry()` calls.

```typescript
await db.transaction(async (txn) => {
	const log = txn.useLog('foo');
	log.addEntry(Buffer.from('hello'));
});
```

Note that the `TransactionLog` class also has internal methods `_getMemoryMapOfFile`,
`_findPosition`, and `_getLastCommittedPosition` that should not be used directly and may change in
any version.

#### `log.path: string`

Returns the path to the transaction log store files.

```typescript
const log = db.useLog('foo');
console.log(log.path);
```

#### `log.query(options?): IterableIterator<TransactionLogEntry>`

Returns an iterable/iterator that streams all log entries for the given filter.

- `options: object`
  - `start?: number` The transaction start timestamp.
  - `end?: string` The transction end timestamp.
  - `exclusiveStart?: boolean` When `true`, this will only match transactions with timestamps after
    the start timestamp.
  - `exactStart?: boolean` When `true`, this will only match and iterate starting from a transaction
    with the given start timestamp. Once the specified transaction is found, all subsequent
    transactions will be returned (regardless of whether their timestamp comes before the `start`
    time). This can be combined with `exactStart`, finding the specified transaction, and returning
    all transactions that follow. By default, all transactions equal to or greater than the start
    timestamp will be included.
  - `readUncommitted?: boolean` When `true`, this will include uncommitted transaction entries.
    Normally transaction entries that haven't finished committed are not included. This is
    particularly useful for replaying transaction logs on startup where many entries may have been
    written to the log but are no longer considered committed if they were not flushed to disk.
  - `startFromLastFlushed?: boolean` When `true`, this will only match transactions that have been
    flushed from RocksDB's memtables to disk (and are within any provided `start` and `end` filters,
    if included). This is useful for replaying transaction logs on startup where many entries may
    have been written to the log but are no longer considered committed if they were not flushed to
    disk.

The iterator produces an object with the log entry timestamp and data.

- `object`
  - `data: Buffer` The entry data.
  - `timestamp: number` The entry timestamp used to collate entries by transaction.
  - `endTxn: boolean` This is `true` when the entry is the last entry in a transaction.

```typescript
const log = db.useLog('foo');
const iter = log.query({});
for (const entry of iter) {
	console.log(entry);
}

const lastHour = Date.now() - 60 * 60 * 1000;
const rangeIter = log.query({ start: lastHour, end: Date.now() });
for (const entry of rangeIter) {
	console.log(entry.timestamp, entry.data);
}
```

#### `log.getLogFileSize(sequenceNumber?: number): number`

Returns the size of the given transaction log sequence file in bytes. Omit the sequence number to
get the total size of all the transaction log sequence files for this log.

#### `log.getStats(): TransactionLogStats`

Returns a detailed statistics snapshot for this transaction log, including file/transaction
gauges, memory-map usage, recovery positions, purge/retention gauges, and lifetime counters. All
sizes are in bytes; timestamps are milliseconds since the Unix epoch.

```typescript
const log = db.useLog('replication');
const stats = log.getStats();

stats.fileCount; // number of sequence files on disk
stats.totalSizeBytes; // total bytes across all sequence files
stats.memory.mappedBytes; // bytes mapped into memory (virtual address space)
stats.memory.overlayBytes; // POSIX file-backed overlay portion (0 on Windows)
stats.replayGapBytes; // bytes between the last flushed position and the write head
stats.purge.retainedUnflushedFiles; // files past retention but kept (not yet flushed to RocksDB)
stats.totals.transactionsWritten; // lifetime count of transactions written
```

> **Memory note:** `memory.mappedBytes` is virtual address space — the active write file is mapped
> at the full configured `transactionLogMaxSize` on POSIX, so it does not reflect resident memory.
> `memory.overlayBytes` (POSIX only) is the file-backed portion and is the closer proxy for real
> consumption.

The `purge.retainedUnflushedFiles` gauge is useful for diagnosing why logs are not being cleaned
up: a file can be older than the retention period but still retained because its transactions have
not yet been flushed to RocksDB (purging it would be unsafe for crash recovery). The retention
floor — the sequence named by `txn.state`, or the highest sequence when there is no persisted flush
position — is not counted as purgeable even when it is old and fully flushed.

### Transaction Log Initialization

When a database is opened, `rocksdb-js` will automatically discover the transaction log files. If
a corrupt transaction log file is detected, the `log.warn` event is emitted on the global
`RocksDatabase` instance. This should be wired up prior to opening the database.

```typescript
RocksDatabase.on('log.warn', console.warn);

const db = RocksDatabase.open('path/to/db');
```

### Transaction Log Parser

#### `parseTransactionLog(file)`

In general, you should use `log.query()` to query the transaction log, however, if you need to load
an entire transaction log into memory and want detailed information about entries, you can use the
`parseTransactionLog()` utility function.

```typescript
const everything = parseTransactionLog('/path/to/file.txnlog');
console.log(everything);
```

Returns an object containing all of the information in the log file.

- `size: number` The size of the file.
- `version: number` The log file format version.
- `entries: LogEntry[]` An array of transaction log entries.
  - `data: Buffer` The entry data.
  - `flags: number` Transaction related flags.
  - `length: number` The size of the entry data.
  - `timestamp: number` The entry timestamp.

### Transaction Log Validation

#### `validateTransactionLogStore(path, options?)`

Validates a transaction log store directory (`<dbDir>/transaction_logs/<name>`): every
`<sequence>.txnlog` file is checked for a valid header and intact entry framing (using the same
scan as open-time crash recovery), file-name and sequence continuity are checked, and the
`txn.state` side file (when present) is checked for shape and a plausible flushed position.

Validation runs natively on a worker thread and does not require (or open) a database, so it works
on the store of a closed database and on backup snapshots alike. It resolves with a report rather
than throwing when the store is invalid — check `result.valid`. It rejects only when `path` does
not exist or is not a directory.

```typescript
const result = await validateTransactionLogStore('/path/to/db/transaction_logs/mylog');
if (!result.valid) {
	console.error(result.errors);
	for (const file of result.files) {
		console.error(file.file, file.errors, file.warnings);
	}
}
```

Returns a `TransactionLogStoreValidation` object:

- `path: string` The validated store directory.
- `valid: boolean` `true` when there are no store-level errors and every log file is valid.
- `errors: string[]` Store-level errors (malformed file names, corrupt `txn.state`).
- `warnings: string[]` Store-level warnings (sequence gaps, unexpected files).
- `files: TransactionLogFileValidation[]` Per-file results, ordered by sequence number.
  - `file: string` File name, e.g. `"3.txnlog"`.
  - `sequence: number` Sequence number parsed from the file name.
  - `size: number` On-disk file size in bytes.
  - `entries: number` Number of well-formed entries.
  - `validBytes: number` End offset of the validly framed data.
  - `valid: boolean` `true` when the file has no errors.
  - `errors: string[]` Bad header, unsupported version, or mid-file framing corruption.
  - `warnings: string[]` Torn tail (recoverable on next open) and per-entry anomalies.

Options:

- `strict?: boolean` Report conditions that indicate an incomplete snapshot — a torn tail, a
  sequence gap, or a `txn.state` flushed position beyond the newest log file or beyond its file's
  actual size — as errors instead of warnings. A torn tail on a live store is a normal crash
  artifact that open-time recovery truncates, but a backup snapshot must be clean end to end —
  `backups.verify()` uses `strict: true`. Defaults to `false`.

Validating a store that is being actively appended to can spuriously report a torn tail for the
current log file — the tail of an in-flight append is indistinguishable from a crash artifact.

### `steadyClockNow(): number`

Reads the process-wide steady clock. No database handle is needed.

```typescript
import { steadyClockNow } from '@harperfast/rocksdb-js';

const start = steadyClockNow();
// ... work, possibly on other worker threads ...
const elapsedMs = steadyClockNow() - start;
```

Contract:

- **Units / type**: milliseconds with a fractional part, as a `number`. Read from
  `std::chrono::steady_clock` (`CLOCK_MONOTONIC` on Linux, `CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW` on macOS,
  `QueryPerformanceCounter` on Windows).
- **Origin and lifetime**: the origin is unspecified and fixed for the life of the process. Every
  sample taken in the process is in one domain — the main thread and every `worker_threads` worker,
  including workers started or restarted at any later time, under Node, Bun and Deno alike. Samples
  are not meaningful across processes or restarts, and are unrelated to the Unix epoch: never compare
  them with `Date.now()`, `db.getMonotonicTimestamp()` or transaction timestamps.
- **Monotonic, not unique**: a sample taken after another (in real time, on any thread) is `>=` it.
  Two samples can be equal — in the same clock tick, or when two distinct readings round to the same
  double — so treat `==` as "not later" and pair the sample with a sequence number if strict ordering
  is required. On Windows, QPC samples from different threads within ±1 native counter tick also
  have ambiguous ordering; do not use near-equal clock samples alone to prove causality. No
  wall-clock ratchet is applied.
- **Precision**: the double's spacing grows with distance from the origin: about 2 ns at 100 days,
  61 ns at 10 years, 0.49 µs at 100 years. Conversion error is below 0.51 µs per sample through
  100 years from the native origin. This is representation precision, not clock accuracy. Rounding is
  monotone, so distinct readings can only collapse to equality, never invert. The clock's own
  resolution is platform-defined (the C++ duration period is 1 ns on these platforms; actual clock
  resolution can be coarser). The native signed 64-bit nanosecond range is about 292 years in either
  direction from its origin; conversion to `number` does not narrow it.
- **Independent of the wall clock**: `settimeofday`/NTP steps in either direction do not move it. NTP
  frequency slew is platform-defined (`CLOCK_MONOTONIC` is slewed; `CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW` and
  `QueryPerformanceCounter` are not).
- **Suspend**: whether time the host spends suspended counts is platform-defined — `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`
  excludes it on Linux; current macOS `CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW` and Windows QPC include it. Do not
  assume runtime timers (`setTimeout`) use the same suspend policy. Portable suspend-inclusive
  deadlines are not provided by this API.
- **Cost**: one clock read and a double conversion; no lock, no native allocation, no wall-clock read,
  no database or log I/O, no per-worker calibration. Safe from any thread. The runtime may allocate a boxed JS number.

### `currentThreadId(): number`

Returns the current thread ID.

```typescript
import { currentThreadId } from '@harperfast/rocksdb-js';
console.log(currentThreadId());
```

### `registryStatus(): RegistryStatus`

Returns an array containing that status of all active RocksDB instances.

- `path: string` The database path.
- `closeError?: string` The native lifecycle error retaining this registry entry.
- `destroyCleanupPending?: boolean` The native database is closed, but physical path cleanup must
  finish before the next open. Call `destroy()` to retry cleanup.
- `refCount: number` The number of JavaScript database instances plus the registry's reference.
- `columnFamiles: object` A map of column family names and their their info.
  - `userSharedBuffers: number` The count of user shared buffer keys created since the column family
    was opened; entries are never evicted, so this never decreases.
- `transactions: number` The count of active transactions.
- `closables: number` The count of active database, transactions, and iterators.
- `locks: number` The count of active locks.
- `listenerCallbacks: number` The count of in-flight callbacks.

```typescript
import { registryStatus } from '@harperfast/rocksdb-js';
console.log(registryStatus());
```

### `shutdown(): void`

The `shutdown()` will flush all in-memory data to disk and wait for any outstanding compactions to
finish, for all open databases. It is highly recommended to call this in a `process` `exit` event
listener (on the main thread), to ensure that all data is flushed to disk before the process exits.
It throws the first close failure after attempting every claimed database; call it again to retry
any descriptor whose native teardown did not complete. It reports pending destroy-cleanup
tombstones without deleting their paths; retry those with an explicit `destroy()`.

Wrap the call: an exception thrown from an `exit` listener skips every `exit` listener registered
after it, and sets the exit code to 1 unless an `uncaughtException` handler is installed.

```typescript
import { shutdown } from '@harperfast/rocksdb-js';
process.on('exit', () => {
	try {
		shutdown();
	} catch (error) {
		console.error('rocksdb-js shutdown failed', error);
	}
});
```

### `versions: { 'rocksdb': string; 'rocksdb-js': string }`

Returns the `rocksdb-js` and RocksDB version.

```typescript
import { versions } from '@harperfast/rocksdb-js';
console.log(versions); // { "rocksdb": "10.10.1", "rocksdb-js": "0.1.2" }
```

## Checkpoints

### `db.createCheckpoint(targetPath: string): Promise<void>`

Creates a [checkpoint](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Checkpoints) — a point-in-time,
fully independent copy of the entire database (all column families) at `targetPath` — and resolves
once written. Unlike a backup, a checkpoint is a normal, writable database: open it as a new
`RocksDatabase` and it diverges independently from the source.

SST and blob files are **hard-linked** when `targetPath` is on the **same filesystem** as the
database, and **copied** otherwise; other files (such as the `MANIFEST`) are always copied. As a
result the operation is near-instant on the same filesystem and as costly as a full copy across
filesystems. The memtable is flushed so the checkpoint includes the latest writes even when the
WAL is disabled.

Parent directories are created as needed. `targetPath` itself must not already exist — RocksDB
creates the checkpoint directory — and the call rejects with `Create checkpoint failed: target
path exists` if it does (other failures, such as a full disk, surface the RocksDB status message).
The caller is responsible for opening the checkpoint and for eventually deleting the directory.

```typescript
const db = RocksDatabase.open('/path/to/database');
await db.createCheckpoint('/path/to/checkpoint');

// The checkpoint is a normal, writable database.
const branch = RocksDatabase.open('/path/to/checkpoint');
```

## Backups

Backups use RocksDB's `BackupEngine` to capture consistent, incremental, checksum-verified
snapshots of a database. A backup covers the **entire database** — every column family, the
manifest, and (by default) the write-ahead log — so it is not scoped to an individual `Store`.

A backup can be written to a local **directory** (incremental, with a management API) or streamed to
a `WritableStream` as a tar archive with no intermediate copy on disk. See
[docs/backups.md](docs/backups.md) for a full guide covering both modes, restore, checkpoints, and
caveats.

Creating a backup is an instance method (`db.backup()`) because it needs a live database. The
remaining operations act on a backup directory and do not require an open database, so they are
grouped under the `backups` namespace export.

> **Only one backup per directory may be in-flight at a time.** RocksDB has no cross-engine lock on
> a backup directory, so the writing operations — `db.backup()`, `backups.delete()`, and
> `backups.purge()` — take an on-disk lock (a `.backup.lock` file) for the directory.
> `backups.restore()` takes the same lock in **shared** mode: concurrent restores run in parallel,
> but a writer and a restore on the same directory exclude each other, so a `purge` cannot delete
> the backup a restore is copying from. A conflicting operation on the same directory, whether from
> the same process, a `worker_thread`, or a separate process, **rejects** with a "locked" error
> rather than corrupting the backup; retry once the in-flight operation finishes. Operations on
> _different_ directories run in parallel, and the read-only operations (`list`, `verify`) are not
> locked.

```typescript
import { RocksDatabase, backups } from '@harperfast/rocksdb-js';

const db = RocksDatabase.open('/path/to/database');
await db.put('foo', 'bar');

// Create a backup, then restore it into a fresh directory.
const id = await db.backup('/path/to/backups');
await backups.restore('/path/to/backups', '/path/to/restored-db');
```

### `db.backup(backupDir: string, options?: BackupOptions): Promise<number>`

Creates a new backup of the entire database into `backupDir`, creating parent directories as
needed, and resolves with the new backup id (a monotonically increasing integer). Subsequent
backups into the same directory are incremental — unchanged immutable files are shared rather than
re-copied.

When the database was opened with `disableWAL`, the memtable is flushed before the backup by
default so unflushed data is not lost; otherwise flushing follows `options.flushBeforeBackup`.

`backupDir` must not be the database directory itself or a path beneath it — backing up into the
live database directory would write backup files on top of RocksDB's own files. Such a call rejects
before anything is written.

```typescript
const id = await db.backup('/path/to/backups', {
	metadata: 'nightly-2026-06-04',
});
```

`BackupOptions`:

| Option                    | Type      | Default                | Description                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | --------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `backupLogFiles`          | `boolean` | `true`                 | Include write-ahead log files in the backup.                                         |
| `checkDiskSpace`          | `boolean` | `true`                 | Preflight the destination volume and reject if it lacks room for the backup.         |
| `flushBeforeBackup`       | `boolean` | `true` if WAL disabled | Flush the memtable before backing up.                                                |
| `maxBackgroundOperations` | `number`  | `1`                    | Number of background threads used to copy files.                                     |
| `metadata`                | `string`  | `''`                   | Application metadata stored with the backup, returned by `list()`.                   |
| `shareFilesWithChecksum`  | `boolean` | `true`                 | Distinguish shared files by checksum to avoid cross-database clashes.                |
| `shareTableFiles`         | `boolean` | `true`                 | Share files between backups to enable incremental backups.                           |
| `sync`                    | `boolean` | `true`                 | `fsync` backup files (including the transaction log snapshot) for crash consistency. |
| `transactionLogs`         | `boolean` | `false`                | Snapshot the transaction log store into `<backupDir>/transaction_logs/<backupId>/`.  |

When `transactionLogs` is enabled, the log snapshot is staged and atomically renamed into
`<backupDir>/transaction_logs/<backupId>/` only after every file has been copied (and fsynced, per
`sync`), so a crash mid-backup can never leave a partial log snapshot for a listed backup id — a
backup either has its complete snapshot or none. The snapshot is captured just after the RocksDB
engine snapshot, so restored logs may run slightly ahead of the restored key-value data (never
behind it), which is safe for redo-style logs replayed against the restored data.

`checkDiskSpace` (on by default) rejects with an I/O error — its message reports the available and
required bytes — before any files are copied, so a full destination fails fast instead of partway
through (a mid-copy failure can leave zero usable backups). The required size is estimated
conservatively as a full copy of the database's live files, plus the transaction-log snapshot when
`transactionLogs` is set; since a backup only ever copies files, this can never under-estimate.
Incremental backups to a right-sized volume may therefore be over-rejected — set
`checkDiskSpace: false` to skip the check. It also self-disables when free space can't be determined
(e.g. some network filesystems report `0`), so it never blocks a backup on an untrustworthy number.
Only directory-target backups are checked; the streaming backup path is unaffected.

### `db.backup(stream: WritableStream<Uint8Array>, options?: BackupStreamOptions): Promise<void>`

Streams a consistent snapshot of the entire database to `stream` as a tar archive, with **no
intermediate copy written to disk**, and resolves once the stream has been fully written and closed.
Backpressure is honored end to end, so a slow consumer (e.g. an upload) paces the backup rather than
buffering it in memory. The archive unpacks with any tar tool into a directory that opens as a
RocksDB database.

```typescript
import { createWriteStream } from 'node:fs';
import { Writable } from 'node:stream';

await db.backup(Writable.toWeb(createWriteStream('/path/to/backup.tar')));
// Restore: `tar -xf backup.tar -C /restored`, then open '/restored'.

// Or gzip it (`tar -xzf backup.tar.gz` to restore):
await db.backup(Writable.toWeb(createWriteStream('/path/to/backup.tar.gz')), {
	gzip: true,
});
```

`BackupStreamOptions`:

| Option              | Type      | Default                | Description                                                         |
| ------------------- | --------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `flushBeforeBackup` | `boolean` | `true` if WAL disabled | Flush the memtable before streaming.                                |
| `gzip`              | `boolean` | `false`                | Gzip-compress the archive, producing a `.tar.gz` instead of `.tar`. |

Stream backups are always full snapshots (no incremental sharing), have no `backups.*` management
API, and **cannot be resumed** — a failed transfer must be restarted from the beginning. See
[docs/backups.md](docs/backups.md#stream-backups) for details.

### `backups.restore(backupDir: string, dbDir: string, options?: RestoreOptions): Promise<void>`

Restores a backup from `backupDir` into `dbDir` (creating parent directories as needed). The
database must **not** be open at `dbDir`, and the default restore mode is **destructive** — it
purges `dbDir` before restoring. Restoring into the backup directory itself is rejected.

The restore holds the backup directory's `.backup.lock` in shared mode for its duration, so it
rejects with a "locked" error while a writer (`db.backup()`, `backups.delete()`, `backups.purge()`)
is in flight — and writers reject while the restore runs. Concurrent restores from the same
directory are allowed.

Because a restore only reads the backup, the shared lock needs no write access to `backupDir`:
restoring from a **read-only backup directory** (an immutable/WORM store or a read-only-mounted
volume) works — it locks the existing `.backup.lock` read-only, and if the media is read-only for
every process (`EROFS`), the lock degrades to a no-op, since nothing can write the directory and so
no writer can be racing the restore. A mere permission denial is _not_ treated this way — it means
only the current identity is blocked, so a more-privileged writer could still be running, and the
restore fails loudly rather than skipping coordination. Writers always need write access and fail on
a read-only directory.

```typescript
// Restore the latest backup.
await backups.restore('/path/to/backups', '/path/to/restored-db');

// Restore a specific backup id without purging matching existing files.
await backups.restore('/path/to/backups', '/path/to/restored-db', {
	backupId: 1,
	mode: 'keepLatestDbSessionIdFiles',
});
```

`RestoreOptions`:

| Option         | Type                                                                  | Default           | Description                                                  |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `backupId`     | `number`                                                              | latest backup     | The backup id to restore.                                    |
| `walDir`       | `string`                                                              | `dbDir`           | Directory to restore write-ahead log files into.             |
| `keepLogFiles` | `boolean`                                                             | `false`           | Keep existing log files in `walDir` rather than overwriting. |
| `mode`         | `'purgeAllFiles' \| 'keepLatestDbSessionIdFiles' \| 'verifyChecksum'` | `'purgeAllFiles'` | The restore strategy (default purges the destination).       |

### `backups.list(backupDir: string): Promise<BackupInfo[]>`

Lists the non-corrupt backups in `backupDir`, ordered by id.

```typescript
const list = await backups.list('/path/to/backups');
// [{ backupId: 1, timestamp: 1749000000, size: 4096, numberFiles: 3, appMetadata: '' }, ...]
```

Each `BackupInfo` contains `backupId`, `timestamp` (seconds since the epoch), `size` (bytes),
`numberFiles`, and `appMetadata`.

### `backups.delete(backupDir: string, backupId: number): Promise<void>`

Deletes a specific backup. Shared files are reference-counted and only removed once no remaining
backup references them, so this is not equivalent to deleting files manually.

### `backups.purge(backupDir: string, keepCount: number): Promise<void>`

Deletes all but the newest `keepCount` backups.

### `backups.verify(backupDir: string, backupId: number, options?: { verifyWithChecksum?: boolean; verifyTransactionLogs?: boolean }): Promise<void>`

Verifies a backup's file sizes, and optionally their checksums (which requires reading all
backed-up data). Resolves if the backup is intact and rejects otherwise.

When the backup was created with `transactionLogs: true`, the backup's transaction log snapshot
(`<backupDir>/transaction_logs/<backupId>/`) is also validated with
[`validateTransactionLogStore`](#validatetransactionlogstorepath-options) in strict mode — every
log file's header and entry framing must be intact (snapshots are copied on committed entry
boundaries, so even a torn tail fails verification). Set `verifyTransactionLogs: false` to skip.

```typescript
await backups.verify('/path/to/backups', 1, { verifyWithChecksum: true });
```

## Custom Store

The store is a class that sits between the `RocksDatabase` or `Transaction` instance and the native
RocksDB interface. It owns the native RocksDB instance along with various settings including
encoding and the db name. It handles all interactions with the native RocksDB instance.

The default `Store` contains the following methods which can be overridden:

- `constructor(path, options?)`
- `close()`
- `compact(options?)`
- `compactSync(options?)`
- `decodeKey(key)`
- `decodeValue(value)`
- `encodeKey(key)`
- `encodeValue(value)`
- `get(context, key, alwaysCreateNewBuffer?, options?)`
- `getCount(context, options?, txnId?)`
- `getKeys(context, options?)`
- `getKeysCount(context, options?)`
- `getRange(context, options?)`
- `getSync(context, key, options?)`
- `getUserSharedBuffer(key, defaultBuffer?)`
- `hasLock(key)`
- `isOpen()`
- `listLogs()`
- `open()`
- `populateVersion(key, version)`
- `putSync(context, key, value, options?)`
- `removeSync(context, key, options?)`
- `tryLock(key, onUnlocked?)`
- `unlock(key)`
- `useLog(context, name)`
- `verifyVersion(key, version)`
- `withLock(key, callback?)`

To use it, extend the default `Store` and pass in an instance of your store into the `RocksDatabase`
constructor.

```typescript
import { RocksDatabase, Store } from '@harperfast/rocksdb-js';

class MyStore extends Store {
	get(context, key, alwaysCreateNewBuffer, options) {
		console.log('Getting:', key);
		return super.get(context, key, alwaysCreateNewBuffer, options);
	}

	putSync(context, key, value, options) {
		console.log('Putting:', key);
		return super.putSync(context, key, value, options);
	}
}

const myStore = new MyStore('path/to/db');
const db = RocksDatabase.open(myStore);
await db.put('foo', 'bar');
console.log(await db.get('foo'));
```

> [!NOTE]
> A `Store` is bound to a single `RocksDatabase` instance. Passing a store that another
> `RocksDatabase` already owns throws `Store is already in use by another RocksDatabase instance`.
> The claim is durable across `db.close()`, so reopening the original owner does not release it.
> (Sharing a store with the owning database's `Transaction` instances is expected and handled
> internally.)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your custom store overrides `putSync()` without calling `super.putSync()` and it performs its
> own `this.encodeKey(key)`, then you MUST encode the VALUE before you encode the KEY.
>
> Keys are encoded into a shared buffer. If the database is opened with the `sharedStructuresKey`
> option, encoding the value will load and save the structures which encodes the
> `sharedStructuresKey` overwriting the encoded key in the shared key buffer, so it's ultra
> important that you encode the value first!

## Interfaces

### `GetOptions`

Options for `get()`, `getSync()`, and the `getBinary*` methods.

- `options: object`
  - `expectedVersion: number` When set, the [Verification Table](#verification-table) is checked
    before reading. If the slot holds this version, the read is skipped and the
    `FRESH_VERSION_FLAG` sentinel is returned. After a database read, the slot is seeded with the
    version extracted from the value. Requires the column family to be opened with
    `verificationTable: true`.
  - `populateVersion: boolean` When `true`, after a database read the verification-table slot is
    seeded with the version extracted from the value, eliminating the need for a separate
    `db.populateVersion()` call on cold reads. Defaults to `false`.
  - `skipDecode: boolean` When `true`, the value is returned without being decoded. Defaults to
    `false`.

### `RocksDBOptions`

- `options: object`
  - `adaptiveReadahead: boolean` When `true`, RocksDB will do some enhancements for prefetching the
    data. Defaults to `true`. Note that RocksDB defaults this to `false`.
  - `asyncIO: boolean` When `true`, RocksDB will prefetch some data async and apply it if reads are
    sequential and its internal automatic prefetching. Defaults to `true`. Note that RocksDB
    defaults this to `false`.
  - `autoReadaheadSize: boolean` When `true`, RocksDB will auto-tune the readahead size during scans
    internally based on the block cache data when block caching is enabled, an end key (e.g. upper
    bound) is set, and prefix is the same as the start key. Defaults to `true`.
  - `backgroundPurgeOnIteratorCleanup: boolean` When `true`, after the iterator is closed, a
    background job is scheduled to flush the job queue and delete obsolete files. Defaults to
    `true`. Note that RocksDB defaults this to `false`.
  - `fillCache: boolean` When `true`, the iterator will fill the block cache. Filling the block
    cache is not desirable for bulk scans and could impact eviction order. Defaults to `false`. Note
    that RocksDB defaults this to `true`.
  - `readaheadSize: number` The RocksDB readahead size. RocksDB does auto-readahead for iterators
    when there is more than two reads for a table file. The readahead starts at 8KB and doubles on
    every additional read up to 256KB. This option can help if most of the range scans are large and
    if a larger readahead than that enabled by auto-readahead is needed. Using a large readahead
    size (> 2MB) can typically improve the performance of forward iteration on spinning disks.
    Defaults to `0`.
  - `tailing: boolean` When `true`, creates a "tailing iterator" which is a special iterator that
    has a view of the complete database including newly added data and is optimized for sequential
    reads. This will return records that were inserted into the database after the creation of the
    iterator. Defaults to `false`. A tailing iterator ignores a transaction's snapshot: through a
    transaction it still reads the latest committed state, merged with that transaction's staged
    writes.

### `RangeOptions`

Extends `RocksDBOptions`.

- `options: object`
  - `end: Key | Uint8Array` The range end key, otherwise known as the "upper bound". Defaults to the
    last key in the database.
  - `exclusiveStart: boolean` When `true`, the iterator will exclude the first key if it matches the
    start key. Defaults to `false`.
  - `inclusiveEnd: boolean` When `true`, the iterator will include the last key if it matches the
    end key. Defaults to `false`.
  - `start: Key | Uint8Array` The range start key, otherwise known as the "lower bound". Defaults to
    the first key in the database.

### `IteratorOptions`

Extends `RangeOptions`.

- `options: object`
  - `reverse: boolean` When `true`, the iterator will iterate in reverse order. Defaults to `false`.

## CLI

The `rocksdb-js` CLI is a command line interface for interacting with RocksDB databases.

```bash
rocksdb-js [dbpath]
```

Options:

- `-h, --help` Show this help message
- `-r, --readonly` Open the database in read-only mode
- `-v, --version` Show the version information

Available commands:

- `backups <dir> [subcommand]` Manage database backups; with no subcommand or `ls`/`list`, lists the backups in
  `<dir>`. Subcommands: `backup` (create a backup of the open database), `restore <backup-id>`
  (restore into the open database after confirmation; unavailable in read-only mode),
  `verify <backup-id>` (checksum verification, including the backup's transaction log snapshot),
  `delete <backup-id>`, and `purge <keep-count>` (delete all but the newest backups). `delete` and
  `purge` report the recovered disk space.
- `clear` Clear all data in the current column family
- `columns` List column families
- `compact` Compact the current column family
- `count` Count the number of keys in the current column family
- `drop <column>` Permanently drop a column family
- `exit` Exit the REPL
- `get <key>` Get the value of a key
- `help` Show this help message
- `log [name] [file] [entry]` List the transaction log store names and log store files
- `prop <key>` Get a RocksDB property (try "rocksdb.stats")
- `purge-logs <name>` Purge transaction log files older than 3 days
- `put <key> <value>` Set the value of a key
- `query [start] [end]` Query a range of keys
- `remove <key>` Delete a key
- `repl` Open a JS sub-REPL; "db" refers to the current column family
- `stats` Show the statistics for the current column family
- `use [column]` Create a new column family or switch to an existing one
- `verify-logs [name]` Validate the transaction log store files (all stores if no name)

### Building

There are two things being built: the native binding and the TypeScript code. Each of those can be
built to be debug friendly.

| Description                                  | Command                                  |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Production build (minified + native binding) | `pnpm build`                             |
| TypeScript only (minified)                   | `pnpm build:bundle`                      |
| TypeScript only (unminified)                 | `pnpm build:debug`                       |
| Native binding only (prod)                   | `pnpm rebuild`                           |
| Native binding only (with debug logging)     | `pnpm rebuild:debug`                     |
| Debug build everything                       | `pnpm build:debug && pnpm rebuild:debug` |

When building the native binding, it will download the appropriate prebuilt RocksDB library for your
platform and architecture from the
[rocksdb-prebuilds](https://github.com/HarperFast/rocksdb-prebuilds) GitHub repository. It defaults
to the pinned version in the `package.json` file. You can override this by setting the
`ROCKSDB_VERSION` environment variable. For example:

```bash
ROCKSDB_VERSION=10.9.1 pnpm build
```

You may also specify `latest` to use the latest prebuilt version.

```bash
ROCKSDB_VERSION=latest pnpm build
```

Optionally, you may also create a `.env` file in the root of the project to specify various
settings. For example:

```bash
echo "ROCKSDB_VERSION=10.9.1" >> .env
```

### Linux C runtime versions

When you compile `rocksdb-js`, you can specify the `ROCKSDB_LIBC` environment variable to choose
either `glibc` (default) or `musl`.

```bash
ROCKSDB_LIBC=musl pnpm rebuild
```

### Windows C runtime versions

By default on Windows, `rocksdb-js` is compiled with the `/MT` flag. This will statically link the
C runtime making the binary self-contained and portable.

### Building RocksDB from Source

To build RocksDB from source, simply set the `ROCKSDB_PATH` environment variable to the path of the
local `rocksdb` repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb.git /path/to/rocksdb
echo "ROCKSDB_PATH=/path/to/rocksdb" >> .env
pnpm rebuild
```

### Debugging

It is often helpful to do a debug build and see the internal debug logging of the native binding.
You can do a debug build by running:

```bash
pnpm rebuild:debug
```

Each debug log message is prefixed with the thread id. Most debug log messages include the instance
address making it easier to trace through the log output.

#### Debugging on macOS

In the event Node.js crashes, re-run Node.js in `lldb`:

```bash
lldb node
# Then in lldb:
# (lldb) run your-program.js
# When the crash occurs, print the stack trace:
# (lldb) bt
```

### Testing

To run the tests, run:

```bash
pnpm coverage
```

To run the tests without code coverage, run:

```bash
pnpm test
```

#### Native C++ unit tests (GoogleTest)

Build and run standalone native tests (RocksDB + binding `core/` helpers, no Node in the test
binary):

```bash
pnpm test:native
```

Coverage report for native tests (macOS/Linux; requires `lcov`):

```bash
pnpm coverage:native
# open coverage/native/html/index.html
```

Note: Code coverage is not supported on Windows. Tests are run without coverage.

To run a specific test suite, for example `"ranges"`, run:

```bash
pnpm test ranges
# or
pnpm test test/ranges
```

To run a specific unit test, for example all tests that mention `"column family"`, run:

```bash
pnpm test -t "column family"
```

Vitest's terminal renderer will often overwrite the debug log output, so it's highly recommended to
specify the `CI=1` environment variable to prevent Vitest from erasing log output:

```bash
CI=1 pnpm test
```

By default, the test runner deletes all test databases after the tests finish. To keep the temp
databases for closer inspection, set the `KEEP_FILES=1` environment variable:

```bash
CI=1 KEEP_FILES=1 pnpm test
```
