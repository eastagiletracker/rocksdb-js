/**
 * Process-wide cache verification table.
 *
 * A fixed-size, lock-free array of std::atomic<uint64_t> slots, addressed by
 * a hash of (db pointer, column family id, record key). Each slot encodes:
 *
 *   bit 63        : tag (0 = version, 1 = lock or settled-empty)
 *   bit 62        : among tagged values, 0 = lock, 1 = settled-empty
 *   versions      : the full uint64 is the version bit pattern (bit 63 == 0)
 *   locks         : bits 61..48 a 14-bit generation, bits 47..0 a LockTracker*
 *   settled-empty : bits 61..0 a 62-bit monotonic settle generation
 *
 * Real Harper record versions are positive float64 timestamps; their sign bit
 * is always 0 when their bit pattern is interpreted as uint64, so bit 63 is
 * available as the tag bit without colliding with any real version.
 *
 * A slot holds 0 only before its first write/populate. After a write cycle
 * settles it never returns to 0 — it goes to a *settled-empty* marker carrying a
 * fresh, ever-increasing generation. This is what makes the lock-free cold
 * populate safe: a populate is a single CAS from the value observed *before* the
 * read (see populateVersionIfUnchanged); because a completed write cycle always
 * moves the slot through a lock and then to a new generation, it can never
 * restore the pre-read value, so an intervening write always fails that CAS and
 * a stale/superseded version can never be published (no ABA on the empty state).
 *
 * Hash collisions are intentional. Two different keys hashing to the same
 * slot will spuriously share state; this can cause false invalidations
 * (revert to slow path) but never incorrect results.
