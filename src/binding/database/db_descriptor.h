 * `DBDescriptor`, with one lazily-started thread tracking every outstanding

 *
 * Deliberately standalone — it holds no reference back to its descriptor, and
 * nothing reachable from `fire()` touches the descriptor or `DBRegistry`.
 * `fire()` is called from a `LockTracker` wake callback, which
 * `LockTracker::wake()` invokes inline while the *process-global* VT
 * `writerMutex_` is held (`VerificationTable::releaseWriteIntent` and
 * `cancelForDB` both wake under it), so the standing invariant on that path is:
 * do not block, and do not re-enter the VT or the registry. A
 * `DBRegistry::PurgeIfUnreferenced` from there can claim the purge and run
 * `finishClose()` -> `cancelForDB()` -> a second lock of that same
 * non-recursive `writerMutex_`, wedging every database's write-intent path.
 * Holding the wake closure's `weak_ptr` on this object rather than on the
 * descriptor is also what keeps its transient `.lock()` out of the
 * descriptor's `use_count`, which `PurgeIfUnreferenced` keys its "no handles
 * left" decision on — so there is no purge-skip window to retry in the first
 * place (the HarperFast/rocksdb-js#672 hazard).
 *
 * Parks are keyed by a monotonic `id`, not the entry's address:
 * `LockTracker::wakeCallbacks` has no removal API, so a stale closure can
 * outlive its entry and an address-keyed lookup could resolve a later,
 * unrelated park that reused the freed address. `fired` is the exactly-once
 * gate shared with that park's wake callback — whichever side wins the CAS
 * calls+releases `tsfn`, always under `mutex` so a concurrent `releaseByEnv()`
 * for a dying env cannot observe "nothing to cancel" while the other side is
 * mid-call on that env's tsfn.

	 *     compaction cancellation are one step. Arming it any later reopens the
	 *     window this exists to close: `finishClose()` drains
	 *     `operationsInFlight` with an untimed wait, and a synchronous
	 *     `compactSync()`/`clearSync()` blocks it for the compaction's whole
	 *     duration. `DestroyDB`/`Shutdown` also claim every entry for a path
	 *     under one lock and then close them sequentially, so arming at claim
	 *     time cancels compactions on descriptors whose own `finishClose()` has
	 *     not started yet.
	 *  2. It is never cleared. Close-initiated compaction passes a null cancel
	 *     token instead, since nothing external is waiting on it, and a
	 *     descriptor never leaves the closing state.
	 *  3. It covers synchronous compaction only. Async `compact()`/`clear()`
	 *     released their OperationGuard at setup handoff, so this drain does not
	 *     await them; they are awaited by `DBHandle::close()`'s async-work drain
	 *     and cancelled by the per-handle token, which a self-close arms before
	 *     it ever reaches `beginClose()` and a foreign close arms from
	 *     `finishClose()` ahead of its first blocking step. See
	 *     `DBHandle::compactCancelRequested` and AGENTS.md invariant 6.
	 *  4. It is private to this descriptor and never aliased onto `closing`.
	 *     RocksDB writes through this pointer -- `DisableManualCompaction()`
	 *     sets the caller's atomic -- and `closing == true` means the registry
	 *     has an owner committed to running `finishClose()`. Letting RocksDB
	 *     publish that state would leave a half-closed descriptor with no
	 *     closer, wedging every later open of the path.
	 *
	 * Covered by `test/fixtures/fork-compact-cancel-sync.mts`, which fails both
	 * if the token stops reaching RocksDB and if arming moves past the in-flight
	 * drain. It does not separate arming here from arming at the top of
