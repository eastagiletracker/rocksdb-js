	 * can run without causing a stall. That wait has no timeout, so a database sitting in a stall
	 * condition — immutable-memtable backlog, L0 stop trigger, pending-compaction-bytes limit, an
	 * exhausted WriteBufferManager budget — blocks the caller for as long as the condition lasts.
	 * `flush()` runs on the libuv threadpool, so there the wait shows up as a promise that simply
	 * never settles while the event loop stays alive — and it parks that whole worker, not just
	 * the caller's promise: `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE` defaults to 4, so a handful of concurrently
	 * stalled flushes can exhaust the pool and stall every unrelated `fs`/`dns`/`crypto` call and
	 * cold-cache `get()` in the process, not only this database's own operations. `flushSync()`
	 * takes the same wait on the JS thread, so it is the worse of the two here rather than the
	 * safer one: it freezes the event loop outright instead of parking a pool worker, and it holds
	 * the in-flight operation claim that `close()` waits on for the duration.
	 *
	 * Pass `true` when the flush is a durability gate the caller is blocked on and stalling
	 * writers is the acceptable cost of it completing — decide that up front, before issuing the
	 * call, since there is no way to cancel an in-flight `flush()` and turn `true` into an escape
	 * hatch after the fact. It is also not a free way out of an existing stall: forcing the
	 * memtable switch adds another L0 file to the level whose file count may be *causing* the
	 * stop trigger, so it can prolong the condition it is meant to clear. Weigh the cost
	 * database-wide, not per-caller: a flush covers **every column family** on the database, and
	 * the descriptor is process-global and shared across `worker_threads`, so the stall lands on
	 * every other column family and every other handle that opened the same path — not just the
	 * one you called. It also relocates the hang rather than removing it: a stalled `db->Write()`
	 * blocks the database's single `CommitWorker` thread, which dispatches every
	 * `Transaction.commit()` in order, so the stall queues up every commit behind it — including
	 * ones from callers that never touched flush — until the stall clears.
	 *
	 * Note this is a *different* knob from the `writeBufferManagerAllowStall` config, and their
	 * polarity is nearly opposite: that one decides whether the WriteBufferManager may stall
	 * writers at all, this one decides whether a manual flush is willing to cause a stall rather
